Good morning, and thank you for joining us With me today are Robert Ford, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Funck, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer Robert and Bob will provide opening remarks Following their comments, we will take your questions\\r\\nBefore we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2022 Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are

as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law  \\r\\nOn today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott\", 'Sentiment': 'Neutral'}, (1, 2): {'Text': \"com Note that Abbott has not provided the GAAP financial measure for organic sales growth on a forward-looking basis, because the company is unable to predict future changes in foreign exchange rates, which could impact reported sales growth Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange  \\r\\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Robert Thanks, Scott Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us Today, we reported results of another strong quarter Earnings per share were $173, reflecting more than 30% growth compared to the prior year Sales increased 175% on an organic basis in the quarter, led by double-digit growth in Medical Devices, Established Pharmaceuticals as well as Diagnostics, both with and without COVID testing-related sales  \\r\\nIn addition to these strong results during the quarter, we continue to strengthen our strategic position and long-term growth opportunities with regulatory approvals of new products and expanded indications of use along with continued market uptake of several recently launched products in attractive growth areas  \\r\\nI'll now summarize our first quarter results in more detail before turning the call over to Bob And I'll start with Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, where sales increased 135% in the quarter EPD has now achieved double-digit organic sales growth in 3 of the last 4 quarters Strong performance this quarter was

brands And we also achieved double-digit growth globally in our combined toddler nutrition products, which includes our market-leading PediaSure and Pedialyte brands  \\r\\nAs you know, however, we initiated a voluntary recall in February of certain infant formula products manufactured at one of our US facilities It's important to highlight as part of our quality system, we retain in-house samples of products that we ship to customers Testing of retained samples related to this recall action by both Abbott and the FDA have all come back negative for the presence of the bacteria that cause the reported illnesses  \\r\\nImportantly, the FDA and CDC found that there is no genetic match between the strains of the bacteria identified in nonproduct contact areas of our facility and available samples obtained from customer complaints, suggesting a different source of contamination  \\r\\nAnd lastly, no salmonella was found in our factory or product and, therefore, the FDA ruled out any link to our facility We hope these findings get parents, caregivers and other stakeholders renewed confidence in our products We know the situation has further exacerbated industry-wide infant formula supply shortages That's why we're doing everything possible to mitigate supply constraints by bringing in product from our FDA registered facility in Europe and ramping up production at our other US plants And of course, we're working very closely with the FDA on proactive actions and enhancements so that we can restart operations at the facility\", 'Sentiment': 'Negative'}, (1, 4):

innovative suite of diagnostic instruments and expanding menus across our testing platforms  \\r\\nAnd I'll wrap up with Medical Devices, where sales grew 115% in the quarter This strong performance was led by double-digit growth in Diabetes Care, Structural Heart, Heart Failure and Electrophysiology In Diabetes Care, sales of FreeStyle Libre grew more than 25% on an organic basis in the quarter and the user base has now reached approximately 4 million users globally In Cardiovascular Devices, while procedure volumes were negatively impacted by elevated COVID case rates early in the year, we saw a steady improvement in procedure trends as the case rates came down in the second half of the quarter, which has continued into April  \\r\\nIn addition to improving market trends and our strong results, this was also another highly productive quarter for our pipeline In the US, we received FDA approval for Aveir, our leadless pacemaker to treat patients with slow heart rhythms In Japan, expanded reimbursement for Libre will now cover all people with diabetes who use insulin at least once a day  \\r\\nCardioMEMS received an expanded indication in the U\", 'Sentiment': 'Positive'}, (1,

Sure, Robbie I think you've been on these calls for a while We rarely raised in Q1, I would say And despite that, I mean, we've had a great start to the year as pointed out And there's a lot of good things going on at the company We talked a little bit about procedure recovery in the comments\", 'Sentiment': 'Neutral'}, (1, 8): {'Text': \" We've seen good recovery in our device portfolio, especially in cardiovascular, seen routine diagnostic testing improving albeit a little bit slower than what we've seen in devices, but definitely the trend of recovery is there \\r\\nEPD execution is going very well, like I said in the comments, 3 out of 4 quarters, double digit, strong COVID sales, both in the US and internationally I think that's an important aspect here is our international presence, too Talked a little bit about the pipeline and the approvals, not just the recent approvals, but the performance of some of the recently launched products Bob talked about our cash flow generation and the deployment of that cash flow We're able to kind of share part of that cash flow with our shareholders, but also to continue to invest in the business \\r\\nSo there's a lot of good things going on here in the business, and -- but there are a couple of challenges that we're managing, and that's probably the piece there where the reconciliation that you're looking for is actually happening First of all, obviously managing through the recall on the nutrition side, we're working with the FDA And we've contemplated in that reiterated guidance, various scenarios here in terms of kind of restart dates and share recovery curves, et cetera So it's simple to give an exact date right now as to when that restart starts We're working closely with the FDA, but I see this more as a shorter-term challenge in the sense that once we align with restarting with the FDA then we'll begin to execute our strategy here in terms of coming back to market, resupplying the market and regaining the share \\r\\nProbably the second other part here, which is I think is a little bit not unique to Abbott And I think you'll probably see this across a lot of companies is just the macro environment right now is -- has definitely changed versus where we were in January And it's gotten a little bit more challenging\", 'Sentiment': 'Positive'}, (1, 9): {'Text': \" So -- and we expect some of that macro environment, whether it's supply chain, et cetera, to kind of be a little bit more persistent throughout this year \\r\\nSo that being said, I wanted to see how these -- probably these 2 points here play out over the next couple of months, and we'll be in a better position to be able to assess that and on our guidance going forward after Q2 But like I said, there's a lot of great momentum in the business Devices performing very well Diagnostics performing very well The parts of nutrition that weren't impacted by the recall continue to do very well\\r\\nI'm not a big fan of the -- exclude this, but for that statement, but I think in the context of how the business is performing, I mean if you exclude the COVID piece, which was pretty significant for us and then just look at the business without the base business, without the impacted nutrition products, our growth rate was about 11% And I think that reflects the strength of the portfolio, the investments that we've made and the execution So in that guidance, that reiteration of $470 million, we've absorbed, as Bob said, more FX headwinds, absorbed some challenges in supply chain, absorbed portions of the nutrition recall So I think it's the right EPS guide right now in terms of where we are after Q1 Great And maybe as a follow-up, I think a lot of investors are focused on the go forward, realizing that January and February weren't the strongest months due to some of the elevated Omicron levels So we heard Johnson & Johnson yesterday talk about reaching pre-COVID volume levels in April It sounds like you exited and continue to see strong growth coming out of the quarter and into second quarter I was hoping maybe you could give us a little more color on just the volume trends you're seeing, particularly in devices and diabetes, which was one that missed the street a little bit in the quarter? And how you're seeing the geographic spread and any differences there? Sure I mean I think the storyline here was very similar, as I said in my comments I mean it started off a little bit slower than we had anticipated in January, obviously, given Omicron and the surges there and the pressure that, that put on staff at hospitals\", 'Sentiment': 'Neutral'}, (1, 10): {'Text': \" But definitely sequential improvement from a dollar perspective every month as we moved along the quarter, March was very strong I've always talked about how we compare our businesses versus pre-pandemic levels to kind of avoid some of the comp issues that ultimately do exist \\r\\nIf you look at our Q1 '22 growth rate versus 2019, we were up about 73% So well ahead of where we were in 2019 And that was pretty broad-based Geographically, the US was up 6%, again versus 2019 And international was up over 8% versus 2019, too So I think our device business has performed very well, and we've seen that improvement as we went through the quarter The cardiovascular side has done very well as I've kind of given those numbers, and March was really strong, too \\r\\nI think it's -- part of it is recovery, Robbie, that we're seeing But also -- I would also put in those numbers, I made these comments about recently launched products that we started launching last year It's always a challenge to launch these new technologies in that COVID environment, but it was the right decision to make, and we're seeing good momentum on whether it's Amulet, Navitor in Europe, CardioMEMS, the rollout of EnSite X that began in Q4 of last year, our TriClip product So I think all of that, it's the combination, I would say, of both recovery as the COVID cases subside, but also the new product launches and the pipeline that we put, which is driving this performance where, I'd say, we're ahead of where we were in 2019, having good growth rate in our cardio portfolio Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI\", 'Sentiment': 'Positive'}, (1, 11): {'Text': \" Robert, maybe back on the guidance question, right The testing guidance was raised by $2 billion, right? That's perhaps $040 of upside and reiteration of the EPS, like what is offsetting the incremental tailwind from COVID rate? Like how much of this is FX, was this macro Russia versus the recall or inflationary pressures, I think, a little bit more granularity will be helpful Sure Well, I mean I think you hit on the key points there I mean inflation -- additional inflation pressures is impacting some of that We've got a couple of hundred million dollars that we've contemplated throughout the rest of the year in terms of friction on supply chain costs, input costs, freight and distribution \\r\\nThe recall -- well, let me take a step back, the FX is probably about another about $005 of friction that we're having as we've seen the dollar strengthen and the rest of it is really coming from nutrition, but it's very difficult right now to be able to kind of pinpoint exactly We've got a couple of different scenarios, as I said in the first question in terms of the restart and the curve So we are seeing more COVID tests and more COVID sales And that, like I said, is absorbing some of these challenges And then one on Libre Sequentially, your revenue has declined And I guess my question is you've been adding, I think, a couple of hundred thousand new patients starts Is that new patient starts changing at all? How should we think about the incremental reimbursement in Japan? And was the seasonality or what drove the sequential Libre revenue trends?

Okay Josh, I'll take the kind of the gross margin question In the first quarter, our gross margin certainly benefited from the very high COVID testing sales As I mentioned in my remarks, that actually, the fall-through on that was higher than we've seen in the past because of the production volumes that we had going through our plant, we're basically running full out on that So our first quarter definitely benefited from that\\r\\nAs we look at the rest of the year, obviously, we're going to have the impact of the nutrition recall and the inflation, the increased inflation that Robert mentioned Obviously, inflation is not unique to us\", 'Sentiment': 'Neutral'}, (1, 16): {'Text': \" As we said back in January, we incorporated a sizable amount in our guidance at that point in time And what we've seen, and I think a lot of other companies have seen as kind of an increase in some of those headwinds And so we've captured that in our guidance for the rest of the year \\r\\nWhen I think out beyond this year and where gross margin goes, I mean, gross margin is something we focus on in the company constantly We've got dedicated teams within each business that are focused on driving gross margin improvements I mean, a lot's going to depend, I think, as we think out in the future, the evolution of inflation and supply chain dynamics and how those evolve over time, that will be a key component And then obviously, as we grow the top line in our medical device business, that's accretive to the overall profile of the company And so that's kind of where we see gross margin right now and potentially in the future Yes On your question on MitraClip and Amulet, so I'll talk a little bit about MitraClip I'd say the progression of MitraClip in the quarter was very similar to my commentary on our cardiovascular procedure, right? So we obviously had high COVID case kind of impacted but started to really accelerate growth towards the end of February and into March So as those cases came down, we saw the improving growth rate \\r\\nBut I'll tell you, I mean, while the growth rate has been strong and it's been strong for a while, Josh, I don't think we've really been able to benefit yet from the FMR indication, which we got kind of right in the middle of COVID And as part of that, and I talked a little bit about this, to be able to benefit from this pretty significant kind of market expansion opportunity that we had with incredible robust data from COAPT, you have to really start to work those patient referrals and the referral networks And we began doing that when COVID took its first break, and then that got put on hold again when Delta and Omicron served So I'm really looking forward and the team is kind of already putting in place that strategy, again, to reengage the patient referral network so that we can really take advantage of this indication, which is unique to us and will be unique to us for a while \\r\\nRelating to competitive movements into the market, we just got to stay ahead\", 'Sentiment': 'Negative'}, (1, 17): {'Text': \" We've got to keep on investing in the product So we've done that with MitraClip, staying ahead and iterating and improving on the performance of the product We're investing in new trials I talked about our investment that we're making in moderate risk surgery patients That will be a great opportunity for us \\r\\nAnd we have a great team, and we have great relationships and a strong mitral position So not discounting the fact that we'll have competition We've had competition in Europe for a couple of years already Germany is probably the second largest global market, and our position there remains at an 80% market share So I acknowledge that we will have competition, but we do -- we have established this mitral leadership position, and we intend to defend it because of all the investments that we've made to create this market So that's what I would talk about MitraClip I still think the best is still to come because I don't think we've been able to tap into the opportunity of the FMR indication \\r\\nRegarding Amulet, listen, I think the team has done a really good job, again, reiterating the same kind of comments, a little bit challenged in the beginning of the quarter And that was predominantly driven by the fact that we wanted to start the initial cases with every case being proctored So difficult to move proctors throughout the US and travel international, et cetera\", 'Sentiment': 'Positive'}, (1, 18): {'Text': \" \\r\\nSo that slowed us down a little bit in the beginning of the year But I'll tell you, the team has done -- we spent a lot of time and attention and focus with them in February and March And the team has definitely had a really strong exit to Q1, caught up in terms of all the contract closes that we had established as part of our plan in Q1 \\r\\nSo I think the commercial execution is doing really well, and that's supported really by the performance of the product And once physicians have had an opportunity to get a couple of these implants done, it's a little bit of a different technique, but they feel comfortable with it and then they get the benefits of what the data shows is superior closure And that's really because of our unique dual ceiling mechanism \\r\\nSo there was some data that came out -- late-breaking data that came out of the AACC, which talked about the importance of leaks and leaks matter, whether they're big leaks or whether they're small leaks, they do matter And even the small leaks were associated with an increase in thromboembolic events So I think we're in a good position now with Amulet I'm pleased with the commercial team and what they're doing in the clinical team, and we've got opportunities here to grow I think momentum is building with Amulet Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo So Robert, 2 high-level questions for me One, I'll push my luck a little bit and see if we can get any preliminary thoughts on 2023 You're getting a meaningful testing benefit this year, which may not materialize next year So how do you feel about your ability to grow margins and earnings next year as testing demand drops? And I have one follow-up Sure\", 'Sentiment': 'Positive'}, (1, 19): {'Text': \" Well, we had a really strong quarter regarding testing, Larry And I think to answer your question, I think you have to kind of look at what's going on a little bit right now in the US and internationally In the US, we saw cases decline pretty significantly in February But I think we all agree that some of those cases that are being reported aren't covering all cases because of the use of the at-home testing systems, right, that are currently available So I think that's part of the process that we're seeing as testing -- as we're moving more into this kind of endemic state \\r\\nAnd as we move to this endemic state, listen, vaccines have been incredibly powerful to be able to prevent serious illness to be able to protect the hospitals and the hospital system, but it's really testing that really allows us to kind of move to this endemic state and kind of live our day-to-day and it's more about surveillance and screening and checking So -- and I think our product has done really well here It's maintained a kind of preferred status here in the US, even with a pretty significant increase in product coming into the country, whether it's ease of use, its shelf life, the reliability it has, its studies, et cetera \\r\\nSo I think that, that's an important aspect as we go into 2023 is do we have confidence that even in an endemic state does testing continue?

And any thoughts on the progress you're making with Libre 3 and the FDA would be great, too Sure I think regarding China, I saw a little bit of an inverse in terms of what we saw in all the other geographies where started off pretty well in the quarter And then as the lockdown started to occur, specifically in Shanghai towards the end of February and into March, started to kind of see the impact of that in our procedures \\r\\nWe look at our testing platforms as kind of an early indicator and a proxy So we saw those go down also during the month of April -- during the month of March And I'd say, over the last 2 weeks in April, started to see a recovery of those diagnostic testing So I think what we saw was a lot of the testing that was being done in the major kind of cities was shifted over to kind of PCR testing, together with rapid testing and that obviously impacted some of the routine hospital testing \\r\\nBut we're starting to see that now probably 2 solid weeks of kind of positive trend back in the right direction Still not at the level we were before the lockdowns, but definitely starting to move in the right direction there \\r\\nSo I would expect just based on patterns that we've seen in the past that we're starting to kind of move to sequential week-over-week improvements in the procedures And not all procedures are the same Some of them return faster Some of them have a different kind of recovery curve But I do expect kind of the impact that we saw in March and a little bit in the beginning of April and devices start to kind of improve\", 'Sentiment': 'Negative'}, (1, 27): {'Text': \" Sorry, you had a question on Libre 3? Yes, Libre 3 Any update on how the progress is working with the FDA or what the label might look like? Just any additional color would be great Sure Like I mentioned in the call, we filed as an ICGM I don't have much to kind of update you there regarding that I will say that we have moved Libre 3 in Europe into -- from kind of more of a limited rollout in Germany a while back to kind of more of an accelerated conversion from Libre 2 to Libre 3 \\r\\nAnd I think the process started really well in Germany We got initial feedback from physicians, very positive feedback from the reimbursement system also And that gave us the confidence here to kind of really begin to accelerate this market transition in Libre 3 We did that in Libre 2 also when we moved from Libre 1 to Libre 2 in Germany That took us about a year I think it's going to be faster than that with Libre 3 And we've got over 90% reimbursement coverage for Libre 3 in Germany \\r\\nSo that's now moved into high gear, not only in Germany, but for the rest of the year So I'm focused a lot on what we can do with Libre in the countries that we do have it approved And right now, everything that we're seeing is that it is a very, very compelling product Okay\", 'Sentiment': 'Positive'}, (1, 28): {'Text': \" Operator, we'll take one more question Our last question will come from Matt Miksic from Credit Suisse Just in the context of some of these new products, I did want to maybe follow up with just a level set expectations, for example, the Avidity rollout and menu expansion, very strong growth in the quarter Robert, if you could maybe talk about what's the duration of this rollout? I know it started into the pandemic And what does that look like through this year and potentially through next year? \\r\\nAnd then I know you touched this a few times here about Amulet Just love to get your updated thoughts on where you think share could go in the next year, 18 months? You've made some comments in Q4 I know the pace is picking up here in the US?

with clinical chemistry, we're doing with hematology We're doing it with transfusion This has never been done at this kind of scale to be able to really recycle all of our systems So I think that if you look at the way the market is set up, the contracts are lasting between 7 to 10 years So on any given year, you've got 15% of the market that's coming up for an RFP \\r\\nSo regarding its legs like you're asking, I mean, I still think that we've got multiple, multiple years here\", 'Sentiment': 'Neutral'}, (1, 29): {'Text': \" The COVID pandemic definitely slowed that down in terms of the renewal cycles, a lot of hospitals focusing on just dealing with the COVID But I guess what I would say is there's plenty more to come The key here is the balance between -- in that 15% that comes up for RFP, what's renewable to an existing customer and what's kind of share gain And I think the team has done a really good job at being able to look at having a real strong balance about not just defending the base, and we've done that pretty well So I'd say, 9 out of 10 accounts, we've been able to maintain \\r\\nAnd then if you look at the business that's coming up for grabs, I'd say our win rate here is over 50% So when you think about that math, retaining 90% and winning 50% of the new businesses, that's what ultimately drives our top line growth And then once you put those instruments in, then the key aspect here is to be able to expand the menu use of those instruments while they're in an account, right? \\r\\nYou've got the capital deployed, you've got the service cost that's kind of been deployed there So everything we can do to be able to add new menus, new tests, et cetera, is accretive from both the top and the bottom line So that's a big focus of the team on the R&D side is to be able to expand the menus concurrent to what I would say is kind of placement strategy that we have with the new systems \\r\\nSo Amulet -- on your question on Amulet, listen, I think we continue to capture share We estimate that we're in double-digit share position here in the US Longer term, I would say, our aspiration is to build a significant share position The European market is much smaller than the US market\", 'Sentiment': 'Positive'}, (1, 30): {'Text': \" In that market, we have a 50 share So I think the key thing here is for us is to -- every time you're a new player

as you roll it out learn how to use our product, our implant, our system \\r\\nAnd from there, you build off there So I think we'll be looking at not only expansion into new accounts, but also utilization in existing accounts And that's the piece that I'm actually getting very excited about it As we've looked at the accounts that we started back in September and October, we're starting to see nice share movement over there So that's very exciting for us \\r\\nSo let me just close here I think we've had a very strong start to the year, like I said in my prepared comments We've reaffirmed our guidance that we set back in January, absorbing, I would say, impact of the nutrition recall, which we're working hard on to restart Other parts and attrition are doing very well, and I expect them to continue to do very well We're absorbing, as Bob said, challenges with inflation in the supply chain that many companies I know are facing, and we're absorbing some headwinds on FX side

broad-based across several countries, including double-digit growth in India, China, Russia and Brazil, which led to overall sales growth of nearly 185% in our key emerging markets While we continue to see COVID cases surge in several emerging markets, including the recent surge in India, our team is executing at a high level to meet market demand for our medicines\\r\\nAnd lastly, I'll cover Medical Devices, where sales grew 45% in the quarter compared to last year and more than 155% compared to the second quarter of 2019 Strong growth in the quarter was led by Structural Heart, Electrophysiology, Heart Failure and Diabetes Care, all of which grew double digits compared to the second quarter of 2019 In Structural Heart, we achieved the highest number of MitraClip procedures

Or are you starting to see signs of the spread of variants could cause a little lumpiness in the pace of the recovery? Just wanted to get your views on how things are going Sure Listen, we obviously had a very strong quarter in terms of recovery I mean we had planned to see that recovery in the U\", 'Sentiment': 'Positive'}, (2, 8): {'Text': \"S and in Europe and in certain Asian markets, and that recovery has largely played out the way we had anticipated I'd say probably a little bit better even than what we thought I don't think what we're seeing here with relating to like increase in COVID cases, I don't think that you'll see the same -- or at least we're not seeing the same kind of impact in terms of hospitals shutting procedures down, stopping testing, et cetera I think it's a very different situation where we are this year versus where we are last year, even though if you look at the case, global case counts, they're pretty much in line to where we were in October last year We've got therapeutics We've got vaccines We've got testing So we're not seeing that \\r\\nOn the device side, listen, our business has done very well Overall, as I said in my comments, we're up double digits, mid-teens versus the second quarter largely driven by EP, Heart Failure, Structural Heart, Diabetes, as I said And actually, if you look at the cardiovascular-specific recovery, we exited the first quarter at about a 2% growth versus March of 2019 And then if you look at the second quarter, our June growth rate was around about 7% versus June of 2019 So we're seeing this kind of sequential recovery in the procedures as evidenced by our growth rates in our procedures\", 'Sentiment': 'Positive'}, (2, 9): {'Text': \" And we were looking at data yesterday, the first couple of weeks of July are showing that same trajectory, whether it's in the US or whether it's outside the US, generally Obviously, there are some markets that have different kind of trends and paces But I'd say, overall, we're seeing that recovery And that's how we're looking at the rest of the year, Bob, is that continued trajectory in terms of recovery in procedures and diagnostic testing Okay That's really helpful And then my second question for Bob I'd love you to comment on 2 things, if okay One, just you had a nice EPS beat relative to consensus and really relative to the way you guys just guiding the quarter But you're leaving guidance the same\", 'Sentiment': 'Positive'}, (2, 10): {'Text': \" Just wanted to understand that dynamic Why not boost the EPS a little bit? \\r\\nAnd then secondly, if you -- just curious if you think consensus estimates, as we look forward a little bit, are kind of reflecting the way you guys are viewing the world right now And obviously, I'm specifically talking about next year So any preliminary thoughts on whether consensus is sort of capturing the world as you see it? And wondering just about the EPS guidance for this year Yes Bob, I'll take the first question on the guidance for this year Clearly, about 1/3 of that beat was due to the little higher COVID sales than we have projected Obviously, forecasting COVID is quite challenging And so that was about 1/3 of beat About 2/3 really was better performance in the base business versus how The Street had modeled that And so the way we look at it, we gave a pretty wide range on earnings guidance back at the beginning of June And that really kind of accounts for any kind of fluctuations or changes in the COVID testing in the back half of this year as well as kind of underlying base business performance So we feel really comfortable about the range we have and feel that kind of captures different scenarios around COVID testing Bob, on the question of consensus for the rest of the year, I mean, I think this is how we're thinking about the second half of the year\", 'Sentiment': 'Neutral'}, (2, 11): {'Text': \" Obviously, from a top line perspective, we're going to have to lap some of our COVID sales that we had in Q3 and Q4 Obviously, if you looked at last year, that was really the height of our ramp-up in COVID sales But the underlying business, excluding COVID sales, will be getting sequentially better every quarter So we're looking at our base underlying business growing low double digits for the rest of the year \\r\\nFrom a gross margin perspective, we'll see expansion in gross margin versus where we were in Q2 There's obviously maybe some friction on some input costs, commodities, freight, et cetera, the team works hard to kind of offset those So we'll see improvement also as the base business recovers and the margin profiles from that recovery expand \\r\\nAnd we'll continue to make the ramp-up of investments that we talked about from an R&D and SG&A perspective Some of those investments have a faster and more, I'd say, kind of more immediate return So for example, direct-to-consumer advertising in Nutrition or Libre, for example, and some of those investments are a little bit more medium term, whether it's R&D programs or whether it's kind of getting ready for upcoming launches\\r\\nSo the real, I'd say, kind of factor here becomes COVID testing And we gave guidance about a month ago about $4 billion to $45 billion After the 2 quarters, we're about $3 billion, $3\", 'Sentiment': 'Positive'}, (2, 12): {'Text': \"5 billion So we've got between $05 billion and $1 billion to go in the next 6 months And I think that's really the question here is how will testing play itself out in the next kind of second half year, whether it's variants, whether it's vaccination rates, et cetera So that's just something that we're paying attention And as Bob said, that's why our guidance range was pretty wide, which is really to account for that Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan Great Congrats on a good quarter Bob, maybe to follow up on the last question There's a lot of moving pieces down the P&L right now You had a really good operating margin in the quarter I was just wondering if you could update us on the latest on how you're thinking of reinvestment of COVID testing revenues, how that's flowing through the P&L And if you have any preliminary thoughts on the impact or benefit it might add to next year as people think about their models now\", 'Sentiment': 'Neutral'}, (2, 13): {'Text': \" In terms of investment, Robbie, if you look at our SG&A and R&D combined, we're up around $700 million versus the prior year And we expect to kind of sustain pretty strong investment in the base business So we have, as you know, reinvested some of those COVID testing sale profits back into the base business to drive growth going forward As you say, we had a really healthy operating margin profile in the second quarter We're going to see some impact on that operating margin profile the rest of the year with the step-down in those COVID testing sales in the back half of this year That's going to obviously have some impact on our operating margin profile while we sustain a lot of that investment, in particular, in the R&D and SG&A spaces to drive growth the rest of the year and into next year Great And maybe just a quick follow-up We have some -- coming back to new product launches and clinical data sets We have 2 interesting ones coming at ESC later in August with CardioMEMS and with Amulet I was just hoping we could get the latest thoughts on approval timing, product launch potential and how we should think about near-term expectations for product launches, given the COVID environment is still impacting hospitals to a degree Sure On Amulet, we talked about this, right, Robbie We filed with the FDA late last year\", 'Sentiment': 'Positive'}, (2, 14): {'Text': \" We -- right now, we plan to present the data at ESC So that's kind of in the late August time frame We think it's, again, an attractive market, great opportunity for growth for us The product is available in Europe and in those markets, albeit a smaller market than the US We have a 50% market share So we feel very good about our ability here to compete with the product we have \\r\\nRegarding timing, it's one of those I can't give you an exact timing It's definitely, we think, kind of in the second half And then it's just going to depend in terms of impact this year versus next year Obviously, the impact next year is larger And that's just going to depend on when the approval hits this year Obviously, if it's more towards the back end of the year, then we'll see less of an impact If it's sooner, that will be an opportunity for us here to execute on that\", 'Sentiment': 'Neutral'}, (2, 15): {'Text': \"\\r\\nOn CardioMEMS, I guess, similar We think this is another great opportunity I mean, both these products were products when we began the St Jude integration, both of these products were trials that we really wanted to invest in and drive on the clinical evidence and driving the clinical evidence of these 2 products So it's great to see we're in a position now to be able to kind of disclose and share the data from these trials that we put together We filed our label expansion with the FDA on CardioMEMS this second quarter, more towards the end of the second quarter And again, we think it's a great opportunity also And probably in terms of an approval there, not really banking on that approval from a sales perspective this year Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI Congrats on the strong print this morning Robert, maybe one high-level question on the base business here I think there are some confusion this morning On the base ex COVID rate versus pre-pandemic 2019 levels, I think you did 11% in 2Q and that was maybe perhaps low double digits in Q1 So the question I think people are asking is, if we had sequential improvements, is 11% versus 10%, that seems a little light\", 'Sentiment': 'Neutral'}, (2, 16): {'Text': \" But I think that kind of ignores the business mix Maybe perhaps can you talk about what's happening to device business? What was the sequential acceleration? And what is baked in for the back half? Should we continue to see some benefit from backlog and further acceleration? Sure I mean I think the Med Device kind of grew again, Q2 versus 2021 That growth rate has been increasing and has been sequentially improving, as I said, in the first question Obviously, the recovery is not uniform across all businesses So if you look at our device portfolio, one of the parts of the portfolio that we've seen a little bit of a lagging recovery here has been in Neuromodulation, where I'd characterize that as a little bit even more elective than some of the other procedures And we've seen, say, like a little bit of a slower recovery trend in that business versus, say, for example, a Structural Heart, an EP or a Diabetes business\\r\\nSimilar to Diagnostics, our immunoassay and clinical chemistry business, that's growing high single digits in the second quarter versus the second quarter of 2019, and that's an improvement versus where we were in Q1 One of the issues that we see in our Diagnostic businesses, we're seeing a slower recovery in kind of blood donations and that obviously impacts our transfusion business So kind of similar to neuro on the diagnostic side, seen a little of a slower recovery But I'd say those businesses that were more impacted by COVID in Q2 of last year, I'd say they've largely kind of recovered very well, very nicely, and we expect that trend to continue in the second half That's helpful And then maybe one on the product side on CardioMEMS We did some work\", 'Sentiment': 'Neutral'}, (2, 17): {'Text': \" It looks like it's an interesting trial It's a pretty large trial, I think, 3,600 patients enrolled, that's fairly large I guess assuming some of these results, if they were to mimic CHAMPION or the original trial in terms of reduction in heart failure hospitalizations I think mortality is an endpoint here Should CardioMEMS be a multibillion-dollar product for Abbott? The reason I'm asking is historical adoption trends have been quite slow, but your investments in such a large trial suggests some optimism So I'm curious how you guys are thinking about the longer-term opportunity Sure I mean I think a lot of these device segments that we see kind of large opportunities I think the key thing here is to make sure that you put the clinical evidence to be able to kind of create a strong kind of market development approach here And when we looked at CardioMEMS at the time back in 2017, where there were some issues with reimbursement in CMS, ascertaining the max kind of worth reimbursing, et cetera And you had positive CHAMPION's data\\r\\nI'm aware of some of the perceived shortcomings of that trial, but there is also plenty of real-world evidence showing similar benefits and similar results that you had observed in CHAMPION So we looked at this and we believe that this was a significant opportunity in the cardiovascular space We believe that monitoring pulmonary arterial pressure is a great indicator for prevention of acute heart failure and decided to make the investment in a larger trial to either address the perceived shortcomings of CHAMPION or -- and/or augment the data set\", 'Sentiment': 'Positive'}, (2, 18): {'Text': \"\\r\\nSo I'm hesitant to put a number around here, Vijay But I think the viewpoint here is that this is an opportunity as we're building our Heart Failure portfolio together with our LVAD portfolio and even with MitraClip, quite frankly, to really have a comprehensive suite of solutions for it And I think this is going to be an opportunity that we will be intentional about investing, whether it's trial, whether it's clinical and field-based teams to drive it We think the opportunity to expand the label to a Class II and Class IV presents a significant opportunity for us to expand the market and also the indication here to include CardioMEMS with elevated levels of BNP So I think that this is a great opportunity \\r\\nI guess your comment on mortality, I think that's important, but I also know, in talking to health systems, that hospitalization and reduction in hospitalization is still very important Some can argue that maybe you're just kicking the can down the road But I think that if you look at and have conversations with the health care systems, they'll see this as an important reduction Any reduction of hospitalization for this patient population will be significantly important for them So bottom line, yes, I think this is a great opportunity for us and we're being intentional about our investment and making the right clinical evidence to support the adoption so that we can get to numbers that you're referencing or even bigger Our next question comes from Larry

important here, Larry, is the user base And this is a different kind of device business It's a -- we talked about it from a mass market opportunity versus other parts of our device portfolio that might be a little bit more, let's say, call it, nichey versus the size of Libre But the user base is super important because when you've got this kind of retention level that we're seeing on the product, so between 80% and 90-plus percent globally, it really looks more like a subscription-like model And when you're in that subscription-like model and you've got this recurring revenue, the

road map perspective, we're not deviating from kind of how we thought about this, right, which is we will continue to provide superior technology, superior experience to the user, whether it's with the product, whether it's how they get the product and still a value proposition that makes sense for a mass adoption So that's all gone very well, and that will continue to go very well \\r\\nLibre 3, we launched it in, I'd say, in Germany at the beginning of the year here A lot of our focus in that launch, Larry, was just more to understand kind of our marketing messaging, our positioning with our existing portfolio, reactions from physicians and even look at how other users from other CGMs kind of reacted to it And it's basically surpassed my expectations as we went into that pilot launch And so we'll be now transitioning to full launch mode of Libre 3, where we've got approval Specifically in the US, obviously, it's understood that the backlog that exists in -- at the FDA regarding diabetes products And I'm not going to comment on kind of timing here or expectations, but just that we're very excited kind of to be able to bring Libre 3 to the US\", 'Sentiment': 'Positive'}, (2,

thoughts on capital allocation are evolving, given your strong balance sheet We know valuations are relatively high Are there areas where you think valuations look more attractive? And historically, the sweet spot for Abbott's been acquisitions in the $5 billion to $10 billion range Is that still the case? I mean, obviously, St Jude was an exception to that, but just curious to see how your thoughts are evolving on M&A Well, specifically on M&A, there's no change in thoughts there I mean I think rather than have a number tied to it, it's more about does it strategically fit? Do we think that we can execute and drive more value out of it? And that mindset hasn't changed independently of kind of dollar amount there We're obviously actively looking We constantly surveil and survey and pay attention and track What I can say is that we've been probably actively moderating much more than where we were back in 2017 But there are some pretty elevated valuations right now, and I'm not going to do anything here that's going to either dilute our profiles, our growth rates, et cetera\", 'Sentiment': 'Neutral'}, (2, 22): {'Text': \" And key driver here is, is it being strategic? \\r\\nI actually think a lot of opportunity we have from a capital allocation back to kind of how you started the question was we've got a lot of opportunity internally A lot of great returns that we can have with our capital as we deploy them to support these opportunities that we have in our pipeline, specifically regarding kind of manufacturing, kind of ramp-up in capacity, whether it's Libre, whether it's MitraClip, seeing an opportunity here with Adult Nutrition as we've seen kind of several years here of strong kind of double-digit growth in Nutrition So I think we've got a great opportunity to be able to provide a great return to our shareholders by looking at our internal opportunities also Our next question comes from Matt Taylor from UBS So I did want to ask one about COVID testing And we know your guidance for the year here implies lower sales in the last 2 quarters I was wondering if you could just give us any insight into the trends that you're seeing in testing, especially outside of the US where we have less visibility, so we can think about some of these different scenarios that you're baking into the guidance for the rest of the year Sure Well, about a month ago, we talked a lot about COVID testing here And I don't think, over the last 30 days, we've seen anything materially different I would say we continue to see some of that kind of lowered kind of testing volumes in the US\", 'Sentiment': 'Neutral'}, (2, 23): {'Text': \", whether it's PCR but probably a little bit more on the rapid side We did a little bit better than what we had forecasted for the second quarter, and that was largely driven by international markets Still about 80% of our sales are on the rapid side But we did see higher international sales And I'd say, yes, it's probably driven by delta variant A lot of those international sales are more, let's say, kind of tender-driven And we've got great visibility to where cases are rising and our positions in those markets\\r\\nAs a company, our relationships, our understanding of how health authorities in those countries are thinking about their testing And what I can say is we become -- we've definitely become a preferred supplier here because of our scale, our capacity, the quality of our products and our pricing So the question here is going to be, even with surges, are you going to see testing increase? I think we will I think we will see some of that The question will be, geographically, where are we going to see it more? And I think geographically, we'll see more internationally than, at least what I think right now, than what we'll see in the United States from a back half perspective Got it And maybe I could just ask one follow-up on recovery in Diagnostics versus med tech\", 'Sentiment': 'Positive'}, (2, 24): {'Text': \" So I know you called out this issue with blood donations And I guess, excluding that, would you think about the recovery in your core diagnostics business, ex COVID, similar to med tech, should it go in lockstep?

Yes Like at a high level, I would say, yes, we're seeing kind of that same kind of recovery trend, again, within its own kind of segment Our immunoassay and clinical chemistry business, which represents about 80% of our core lab business, that actually was up high single digits in Q2 versus Q2 of 2019 So we are seeing that recovery on the core lab There are some assays that haven't recovered as much What we've seen here in the US is that we're seeing post-surgery policies here from certain hospitals do less overnight stays So when you're doing that, you're getting a little bit less of that But I'd say that's offset with higher share gain and growth in new accounts with the rollout of Alinity So we're seeing that kind of high single digit\\r\\nAnd as you mentioned, the issue is really kind of low donation, blood donations that are impacting our transfusion business, which we've got 65%, 60-plus percent market share So we're hoping to see -- we've been working with different agencies here to kind of bring awareness to this fact here because, obviously, there's inventory of blood\", 'Sentiment': 'Neutral'}, (2, 25): {'Text': \" But if this rate of donations continues, then it will be a challenge for the US So hopefully, we'll start to see that recover here as we get towards the end of the year Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank It's really 2 questions The first one is a follow-up on what Bob was asking earlier on, is there anything that you can give us on 2022? I'm getting a lot of questions as it relates to margins, COVID, double-digit EPS So anything on a framework basis that would be helpful I'd appreciate it Sure Listen, we've talked about this a couple of times on a couple of calls already, and I just think it's a little bit too early to kind of provide that forecast given there's so many different kind of moving parts We're starting our process right now But I don't think the framework changes versus what we've talked about, which is our underlying business, so excluding COVID testing, it will clearly be very well positioned for very strong growth, top line and bottom line just based on the trends that we're seeing, based on the pipeline, the new products that we have in the pipeline that we have in place So our underlying base business will clearly be set up for very strong top and bottom line growth\\r\\nWe've obviously got to look at COVID testing, and that's a factor here\", 'Sentiment': 'Neutral'}, (2, 26): {'Text': \" We talked about it last call It'll be probably not very prudent here to assume a significant amount of COVID testing Now if there's going to be demand of COVID testing, we've got plenty of capacity to meet it, and that's ultimately going to be kind of the factor here As I said, we're going to start to kind of lap a little bit of this testing in Q3 and Q4 of this year We've obviously had a real strong Q1 also So that obviously has an impact And then having to look at our spend and modulate our spend here, but in a way that doesn't detract from our kind of long-term sustainable kind of growth even past 2022, 2023 So we've got a lot of good momentum, a lot of ongoing and upcoming launch activity and I want to make sure that I capitalize on the positions and the opportunities that we've built upon And then I've heard the word pipeline investment a couple of times there Other than some of the names that we've -- or products that we've already focused on, such as Amulet, CardioMEMS and Libre 3, are there other products in the pipeline that you'd like to draw our attention to?

product in Navitor in Europe\", 'Sentiment': 'Neutral'}, (2, 27): {'Text': \" I mean these are 2 opportunities that we have We know our position and we know the choices and the strategy that we'll take as we enter this market here in the US, and I think it's great It will be a great opportunity for us \\r\\nAnd then the second product on Structural Heart is our tricuspid repair system It's a great opportunity It's got a potential kind of billion-dollar market opportunity for it We've done very well with it, actually Right now, our sales have kind of annualized right now on a $100 million basis, and we launched this in the middle of pandemic last year So I think that's a great near-term opportunity \\r\\nAnd then on CRM, we've made the investment here to get our leadless program back on track here regarding a single chamber and then making the investment on a dual chamber And I think that's another kind of big opportunity that we'll have to continue our kind of growth recovery in our CRM So we're targeting to enter this market next year, again, with a single chamber and then build off there\", 'Sentiment': 'Positive'}, (2, 28): {'Text': \" So I think we've got great opportunity in the device space\\r\\nAnd then in the Diagnostics is the continuing of building the menu, the assays, the menu of assays We're obviously making investments in our rapid business to capitalize on the  placements that we've made for ID NOW with COVID to be able to kind of not only drive flu, but other respiratory viruses that we think will be opportunity for us also But I think those are probably more the near term, ie, next kind of 12, 18 months and then a larger pipeline after that And our last question comes from Josh Jennings from Cowen Robert, just wanted to ask a multipart question on just duopolies in the US market You're about to create one with the entrance at Amulet And then down the line, you'll be in a different position as the first mover in the duopoly being created by a competitor coming into the edge-to-edge mitral repair market And I was hoping if you could just give us your views on US\", 'Sentiment': 'Positive'}, (2, 29): {'Text': \" duopolies in terms of second player coming into the market, catalyzing market growth, how you think about that, the risk for competitive pricing to ensue and then the potential for that second mover to capture share and where those can lay out Sure I mean generally speaking, competition will always kind of drive further innovation, further investment So one can kind of make the analysis here that when you're -- when you have a competitor coming into your segment, you'll do more to invest in the business and that investment will then drive the category So I think on one side, I do believe in that, and I think you can see how that's kind of had an impact Definitely, when we came into the US with Libre and kind of what happened to that market and what happened to the technology in terms of kind of making all the technologies better and et cetera So the flip side of that is competition is -- you could potentially see, I guess, price as a lever to drive demand or to drive share capture We've tried to focus every time we're entering markets with a value proposition that sustains our price and our pricing strategy and focus on the benefits that our solution will bring\\r\\nAnd so I think you've got these 2 parts of kind of competition in markets I'd say that's probably true for a 2-player market or a 3-player market So -- but listen, we're excited to come into the LAA market here in the US\", 'Sentiment': 'Positive'}, (2, 30): {'Text': \" We're obviously a player internationally and we're making the investments So for example, we've already begun our investment in market expansion in LAA with our CATALYST trial, which is comparing  our product to NOAC, which is the standard of care And I know that competitors are making kind of similar clinical investment I think that's good I think that's positive \\r\\nOkay So that being said, I'd say here, if I just kind of sum up, our results clearly demonstrated here that we're showing real strong growth across all of our businesses, devices, Diagnostics, our Established Pharmaceutical business and our Nutrition And as I said in the beginning of the call, as we look to the second half of the year, we expect that growth to continue in our underlying business I think to Joanne's question, maybe to Bob's question also, optically, you're going to see a little bit of this, I'd say, artificial fog or lapping here or a comp versus for a few quarters as we kind of go through these sales that we've had from this big role that we played in COVID testing during the pandemic\\r\\nBut I don't let that cloud kind of how we think about the business and how we think about the business long term And I think our forecast here shows that we'll have a pretty differentiated underlying base business performance here Our pipeline is highly productive, we've got a lot of ongoing launch activity and there's even more on the way here So we're very excited about that, and we're investing across our key growth platforms So

out any link to our facility We hope these findings get parents, caregivers and other stakeholders renewed confidence in our products We know the situation has further exacerbated industry-wide infant

Sure, Robbie I think you've been on these calls for a while We rarely raised in Q1, I would say And despite that, I mean, we've had a great start to the year as pointed out And there's a lot of good things going on at the company We talked a little bit about procedure recovery in the comments\", 'Sentiment': 'Neutral'}, (1, 8): {'Text': \" We've seen good recovery in our device portfolio, especially in cardiovascular, seen routine diagnostic testing improving albeit a little bit slower than what we've seen in devices, but definitely the trend of recovery is there \\r\\nEPD execution is going very well, like I said in the comments, 3 out of 4 quarters, double digit, strong COVID sales, both in the US and internationally I think that's an important aspect here is our international presence, too Talked a little bit about the pipeline and the approvals, not just the recent approvals, but the performance of some of the recently launched products Bob talked about our cash flow generation and the deployment of that cash flow We're able to kind of share part of that cash flow with our shareholders, but also to continue to invest in the business \\r\\nSo there's a lot of good things going on here in the business, and -- but there are a couple of challenges that we're managing, and that's probably the piece there where the reconciliation that you're looking for is actually happening First of all, obviously managing through the recall on the nutrition side, we're working with the FDA And we've contemplated in that reiterated guidance, various scenarios here in terms of kind of restart dates and share recovery curves, et cetera So it's simple to give an exact date right now as to when that restart starts We're working closely with the FDA, but I see this more as a shorter-term challenge in the sense that once we align with restarting with the FDA then we'll begin to execute our strategy here in terms of coming back to market, resupplying the market and regaining the share \\r\\nProbably the second other part here, which is I think is a little bit not unique to Abbott And I think you'll probably see this across a lot of companies is just the macro environment right now is -- has definitely changed versus where we were in January And it's gotten a little bit more challenging\", 'Sentiment': 'Neutral'}, (1, 9): {'Text': \" So -- and we expect some of that macro environment, whether it's supply chain, et cetera, to kind of be a little bit more persistent throughout this year \\r\\nSo that being said, I wanted to see how these -- probably these 2 points here play out over the next couple of months, and we'll be in a better position to be able to assess that and on our guidance going forward after Q2 But like I said, there's a lot of great momentum in the business Devices performing very well Diagnostics performing very well The parts of nutrition that weren't impacted by the recall continue to do very well\\r\\nI'm not a big fan of the -- exclude this, but for that statement, but I think in the context of how the business is performing, I mean if you exclude the COVID piece, which was pretty significant for us and then just look at the business without the base business, without the impacted nutrition products, our growth rate was about 11% And I think that reflects the strength of the portfolio, the investments that we've made and the execution So in that guidance, that reiteration of $470 million, we've absorbed, as Bob said, more FX headwinds, absorbed some challenges in supply chain, absorbed portions of the nutrition recall So I think it's the right EPS guide right now in terms of where we are after Q1 Great And maybe as a follow-up, I think a lot of investors are focused on the go forward, realizing that January and February weren't the strongest months due to some of the elevated Omicron levels So we heard Johnson & Johnson yesterday talk about reaching pre-COVID volume levels in April It sounds like you exited and continue to see strong growth coming out of the quarter and into second quarter I was hoping maybe you could give us a little more color on just the volume trends you're seeing, particularly in devices and diabetes, which was one that missed the street a little bit in the quarter? And how you're seeing the geographic spread and any differences there? Sure I mean I think the storyline here was very similar, as I said in my comments I mean it started off a little bit slower than we had anticipated in January, obviously, given Omicron and the surges there and the pressure that, that put on staff at hospitals\", 'Sentiment': 'Neutral'}, (1, 10): {'Text': \" But definitely sequential improvement from a dollar perspective every month as we moved along the quarter, March was very strong I've always talked about how we compare our businesses versus pre-pandemic levels to kind of avoid some of the comp issues that ultimately do exist \\r\\nIf you look at our Q1 '22 growth rate versus 2019, we were up about 73% So well ahead of where we were in 2019 And that was pretty broad-based Geographically, the US was up 6%, again versus 2019 And international was up over 8% versus 2019, too So I think our device business has performed very well, and we've seen that improvement as we went through the quarter The cardiovascular side has done very well as I've kind of given those numbers, and March was really strong, too \\r\\nI think it's -- part of it is recovery, Robbie, that we're seeing But also -- I would also put in those numbers, I made these comments about recently launched products that we started launching last year It's always a challenge to launch these new technologies in that COVID environment, but it was the right decision to make, and we're seeing good momentum on whether it's Amulet, Navitor in Europe, CardioMEMS, the rollout of EnSite X that began in Q4 of last year, our TriClip product So I think all of that, it's the combination, I would say, of both recovery as the COVID cases subside, but also the new product launches and the pipeline that we put, which is driving this performance where, I'd say, we're ahead of where we were in 2019, having good growth rate in our cardio portfolio Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI\", 'Sentiment': 'Positive'}, (1, 11): {'Text': \" Robert, maybe back on the guidance question, right The testing guidance was raised by $2 billion, right?

Okay Josh, I'll take the kind of the gross margin question In the first quarter, our gross margin certainly benefited from the very high COVID testing sales As I mentioned in my remarks, that actually, the fall-through on that was higher than we've seen in the past because of the production volumes that we had going through our plant, we're basically running full out on that So our first quarter definitely benefited from that\\r\\nAs we look at the rest of the year, obviously, we're going to have the impact of the nutrition recall and the inflation, the increased inflation that Robert mentioned Obviously, inflation is not unique to us\", 'Sentiment': 'Positive'}, (1, 16): {'Text': \" As we said back in January, we incorporated a sizable amount in our guidance at that point in time And what we've seen, and I think a lot of other companies have seen as kind of an increase in some of those headwinds And so we've captured that in our guidance for the rest of the year \\r\\nWhen I think out beyond this year and where gross margin goes, I mean, gross margin is something we focus on in the company constantly We've got dedicated teams within each business that are focused on driving gross margin improvements I mean, a lot's going to depend, I think, as we think out in the future, the evolution of inflation and supply chain dynamics and how those evolve over time, that will be a key component And then obviously, as we grow the top line in our medical device business, that's accretive to the overall profile of the company And so that's kind of where we see gross margin right now and potentially in the future Yes On your question on MitraClip and Amulet, so I'll talk a little bit about MitraClip I'd say the progression of MitraClip in the quarter was very similar to my commentary on our cardiovascular procedure, right? So we obviously had high COVID case kind of impacted but started to really accelerate growth towards the end of February and into March So as those cases came down, we saw the improving growth rate \\r\\nBut I'll tell you, I mean, while the growth rate has been strong and it's been strong for a while, Josh, I don't think we've really been able to benefit yet from the FMR indication, which we got kind of right in the middle of COVID And as part of that, and I talked a little bit about this, to be able to benefit from this pretty significant kind of market expansion opportunity that we had with incredible robust data from COAPT, you have to really start to work those patient referrals and the referral networks And we began doing that when COVID took its first break, and then that got put on hold again when Delta and Omicron served So I'm really looking forward and the team is kind of already putting in place that strategy, again, to reengage the patient referral network so that we can really take advantage of this indication, which is unique to us and will be unique to us for a while \\r\\nRelating to competitive movements into the market, we just got to stay ahead\", 'Sentiment': 'Neutral'}, (1, 17): {'Text': \" We've got to keep on investing in the product So we've done that with MitraClip, staying ahead and iterating and improving on the performance of the product We're investing in new trials I talked about our investment that we're making in moderate risk surgery patients That will be a great opportunity for us \\r\\nAnd we have a great team, and we have great relationships and a strong mitral position So not discounting the fact that we'll have competition We've had competition in Europe for a couple of years already Germany is probably the second largest global market, and our position there remains at an 80% market share So I acknowledge that we will have competition, but we do -- we have established this mitral leadership position, and we intend to defend it because of all the investments that we've made to create this market So that's what I would talk about MitraClip I still think the best is still to come because I don't think we've been able to tap into the opportunity of the FMR indication \\r\\nRegarding Amulet, listen, I think the team has done a really good job, again, reiterating the same kind of comments, a little bit challenged in the beginning of the quarter And that was predominantly driven by the fact that we wanted to start the initial cases with every case being proctored So difficult to move proctors throughout the US and travel international, et cetera\", 'Sentiment': 'Positive'}, (1, 18): {'Text': \" \\r\\nSo that slowed us down a little bit in the beginning of the year But I'll tell you, the team has done -- we spent a lot of time and attention and focus with them in February and March And the team has definitely had a really strong exit to Q1, caught up in terms of all the contract closes that we had established as part of our plan in Q1 \\r\\nSo I think the commercial execution is doing really well, and that's supported really by the performance of the product And once physicians have had an opportunity to get a couple of these implants done, it's a little bit of a different technique, but they feel comfortable with it and then they get the benefits of what the data shows is superior closure And that's really because of our unique dual ceiling mechanism \\r\\nSo there was some data that came out -- late-breaking data that came out of the AACC, which talked about the importance of leaks and leaks matter, whether they're big leaks or whether they're small leaks, they do matter And even the small leaks were associated with an increase in thromboembolic events So I think we're in a good position now with Amulet I'm pleased with the commercial team and what they're doing in the clinical team, and we've got opportunities here to grow I think momentum is building with Amulet Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo So Robert, 2 high-level questions for me One, I'll push my luck a little bit and see if we can get any preliminary thoughts on 2023 You're getting a meaningful testing benefit this year, which may not materialize next year So how do you feel about your ability to grow margins and earnings next year as testing demand drops? And I have one follow-up Sure\", 'Sentiment': 'Neutral'}, (1, 19): {'Text': \" Well, we had a really strong quarter regarding testing, Larry And I think to answer your question, I think you have to kind of look at what's going on a little bit right now in the US and internationally In the US, we saw cases decline pretty significantly in February But I think we all agree that some of those cases that are being reported aren't covering all cases because of the use of the at-home testing systems, right, that are currently available So I think that's part of the process that we're seeing as testing -- as we're moving more into this kind of endemic state \\r\\nAnd as we move to this endemic state, listen, vaccines have been incredibly powerful to be able to prevent serious illness to be able to protect the hospitals and the hospital system, but it's really testing that really allows us to kind of move to this endemic state and kind of live our day-to-day and it's more about surveillance and screening and checking So -- and I think our product has done really well here It's maintained a kind of preferred status here in the US, even with a pretty significant increase in product coming into the country, whether it's ease of use, its shelf life, the reliability it has, its studies, et cetera \\r\\nSo I think that, that's an important aspect as we go into 2023 is do we have confidence that even in an endemic state does testing continue?

defending the base, and we've done that pretty well So I'd say, 9 out of 10 accounts, we've been able to maintain \\r\\nAnd then if you look at the business that's coming up for grabs, I'd say our win rate here is over 50% So when you think about that math, retaining 90% and winning 50% of the new businesses, that's what ultimately drives our top line growth And then once you put those instruments in, then the key aspect here is to be able to expand the menu use of those instruments while they're in an account, right? \\r\\nYou've got the capital deployed, you've got the service cost that's kind of been deployed there So everything we can do to be able to add new menus, new tests, et cetera, is accretive from both the top and the bottom line So that's a big focus of the team on the R&D side is to be able to expand the menus concurrent to what I would say is kind of placement strategy that we have with the new systems \\r\\nSo Amulet -- on your question on Amulet, listen, I think we continue to capture share We estimate that we're in double-digit share position here in the US Longer term, I would say, our aspiration is to build a significant share position The European market is much smaller than the US market\", 'Sentiment': 'Positive'}, (1, 30): {'Text': \" In that market, we have a 50 share So I think the key thing here is for us is to -- every time you're a new player coming into the market, you have different technology We believe ours is superior, but it's different in terms of how it gets used, how it gets implanted So you need to make sure that the physicians as you roll it out learn how to use our product, our implant, our system \\r\\nAnd from there, you build off there So I think we'll be looking at not only expansion into new accounts, but also utilization in existing accounts And that's the piece that I'm actually getting very excited about it As we've looked at the accounts that we started back in September and October, we're starting to see nice share movement over there So that's very exciting for us \\r\\nSo let me just close here I think we've had a very strong start to the year, like I said in my prepared comments We've reaffirmed our guidance that we set back in January, absorbing, I would say, impact of the nutrition recall, which we're working hard on to restart Other parts and attrition are doing very well, and I expect them to continue to do very well We're absorbing, as Bob said, challenges with inflation in the supply chain that many companies I know are facing, and we're absorbing some headwinds on FX side

nearly 45% in the quarter, led by growth of nearly 9% in the US, where we continue to capture share with our leading portfolio of infant formula and toddler brands Sales of Pedialyte, our global

broad-based across several countries, including double-digit growth in India, China, Russia and Brazil, which led to overall sales growth of nearly 185% in our key emerging markets While we continue to see COVID cases surge in several emerging markets, including the recent surge in India, our team is executing at a high level to meet market demand for our medicines\\r\\nAnd lastly, I'll cover Medical Devices, where sales grew 45% in the quarter compared to last year and more than 155% compared to the second quarter of 2019 Strong growth in the quarter was led by Structural Heart, Electrophysiology, Heart Failure and Diabetes Care, all of which grew double digits compared to the second quarter of 2019 In Structural Heart, we achieved the highest number of MitraClip procedures

Or are you starting to see signs of the spread of variants could cause a little lumpiness in the pace of the recovery? Just wanted to get your views on how things are going Sure Listen, we obviously had a very strong quarter in terms of recovery I mean we had planned to see that recovery in the U\", 'Sentiment': 'Positive'}, (2, 8): {'Text': \"S and in Europe and in certain Asian markets, and that recovery has largely played out the way we had anticipated I'd say probably a little bit better even than what we thought I don't think what we're seeing here with relating to like increase in COVID cases, I don't think that you'll see the same -- or at least we're not seeing the same kind of impact in terms of hospitals shutting procedures down, stopping testing, et cetera I think it's a very different situation where we are this year versus where we are last year, even though if you look at the case, global case counts, they're pretty much in line to where we were in October last year We've got therapeutics We've got vaccines We've got testing So we're not seeing that \\r\\nOn the device side, listen, our business has done very well Overall, as I said in my comments, we're up double digits, mid-teens versus the second quarter largely driven by EP, Heart Failure, Structural Heart, Diabetes, as I said And actually, if you look at the cardiovascular-specific recovery, we exited the first quarter at about a 2% growth versus March of 2019 And then if you look at the second quarter, our June growth rate was around about 7% versus June of 2019 So we're seeing this kind of sequential recovery in the procedures as evidenced by our growth rates in our procedures\", 'Sentiment': 'Positive'}, (2, 9): {'Text': \" And we were looking at data yesterday, the first couple of weeks of July are showing that same trajectory, whether it's in the US or whether it's outside the US, generally Obviously, there are some markets that have different kind of trends and paces But I'd say, overall, we're seeing that recovery And that's how we're looking at the rest of the year, Bob, is that continued trajectory in terms of recovery in procedures and diagnostic testing Okay That's really helpful And then my second question for Bob I'd love you to comment on 2 things, if okay One, just you had a nice EPS beat relative to consensus and really relative to the way you guys just guiding the quarter But you're leaving guidance the same\", 'Sentiment': 'Neutral'}, (2, 10): {'Text': \" Just wanted to understand that dynamic Why not boost the EPS a little bit? \\r\\nAnd then secondly, if you -- just curious if you think consensus estimates, as we look forward a little bit, are kind of reflecting the way you guys are viewing the world right now And obviously, I'm specifically talking about next year So any preliminary thoughts on whether consensus is sort of capturing the world as you see it? And wondering just about the EPS guidance for this year Yes Bob, I'll take the first question on the guidance for this year Clearly, about 1/3 of that beat was due to the little higher COVID sales than we have projected Obviously, forecasting COVID is quite challenging And so that was about 1/3 of beat About 2/3 really was better performance in the base business versus how The Street had modeled that And so the way we look at it, we gave a pretty wide range on earnings guidance back at the beginning of June And that really kind of accounts for any kind of fluctuations or changes in the COVID testing in the back half of this year as well as kind of underlying base business performance So we feel really comfortable about the range we have and feel that kind of captures different scenarios around COVID testing Bob, on the question of consensus for the rest of the year, I mean, I think this is how we're thinking about the second half of the year\", 'Sentiment': 'Neutral'}, (2, 11): {'Text': \" Obviously, from a top line perspective, we're going to have to lap some of our COVID sales that we had in Q3 and Q4 Obviously, if you looked at last year, that was really the height of our ramp-up in COVID sales But the underlying business, excluding COVID sales, will be getting sequentially better every quarter So we're looking at our base underlying business growing low double digits for the rest of the year \\r\\nFrom a gross margin perspective, we'll see expansion in gross margin versus where we were in Q2 There's obviously maybe some friction on some input costs, commodities, freight, et cetera, the team works hard to kind of offset those So we'll see improvement also as the base business recovers and the margin profiles from that recovery expand \\r\\nAnd we'll continue to make the ramp-up of investments that we talked about from an R&D and SG&A perspective Some of those investments have a faster and more, I'd say, kind of more immediate return So for example, direct-to-consumer advertising in Nutrition or Libre, for example, and some of those investments are a little bit more medium term, whether it's R&D programs or whether it's kind of getting ready for upcoming launches\\r\\nSo the real, I'd say, kind of factor here becomes COVID testing And we gave guidance about a month ago about $4 billion to $45 billion After the 2 quarters, we're about $3 billion, $3\", 'Sentiment': 'Neutral'}, (2, 12): {'Text': \"5 billion So we've got between $05 billion and $1 billion to go in the next 6 months And I think that's really the question here is how will testing play itself out in the next kind of second half year, whether it's variants, whether it's vaccination rates, et cetera So that's just something that we're paying attention And as Bob said, that's why our guidance range was pretty wide, which is really to account for that Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan Great Congrats on a good quarter Bob, maybe to follow up on the last question There's a lot of moving pieces down the P&L right now You had a really good operating margin in the quarter I was just wondering if you could update us on the latest on how you're thinking of reinvestment of COVID testing revenues, how that's flowing through the P&L And if you have any preliminary thoughts on the impact or benefit it might add to next year as people think about their models now\", 'Sentiment': 'Neutral'}, (2, 13): {'Text': \" In terms of investment, Robbie, if you look at our SG&A and R&D combined, we're up around $700 million versus the prior year And we expect to kind of sustain pretty strong investment in the base business So we have, as you know, reinvested some of those COVID testing sale profits back into the base business to drive growth going forward As you say, we had a really healthy operating margin profile in the second quarter We're going to see some impact on that operating margin profile the rest of the year with the step-down in those COVID testing sales in the back half of this year That's going to obviously have some impact on our operating margin profile while we sustain a lot of that investment, in particular, in the R&D and SG&A spaces to drive growth the rest of the year and into next year Great And maybe just a quick follow-up We have some -- coming back to new product launches and clinical data sets We have 2 interesting ones coming at ESC later in August with CardioMEMS and with Amulet I was just hoping we could get the latest thoughts on approval timing, product launch potential and how we should think about near-term expectations for product launches, given the COVID environment is still impacting hospitals to a degree Sure On Amulet, we talked about this, right, Robbie We filed with the FDA late last year\", 'Sentiment': 'Positive'}, (2, 14): {'Text': \" We -- right now, we plan to present the data at ESC So that's kind of in the late August time frame We think it's, again, an attractive market, great opportunity for growth for us The product is available in Europe and in those markets, albeit a smaller market than the US We have a 50% market share So we feel very good about our ability here to compete with the product we have \\r\\nRegarding timing, it's one of those I can't give you an exact timing It's definitely, we think, kind of in the second half And then it's just going to depend in terms of impact this year versus next year Obviously, the impact next year is larger And that's just going to depend on when the approval hits this year Obviously, if it's more towards the back end of the year, then we'll see less of an impact If it's sooner, that will be an opportunity for us here to execute on that\", 'Sentiment': 'Neutral'}, (2, 15): {'Text': \"\\r\\nOn CardioMEMS, I guess, similar We think this is another great opportunity I mean, both these products were products when we began the St Jude integration, both of these products were trials that we really wanted to invest in and drive on the clinical evidence and driving the clinical evidence of these 2 products So it's great to see we're in a position now to be able to kind of disclose and share the data from these trials that we put together We filed our label expansion with the FDA on CardioMEMS this second quarter, more towards the end of the second quarter And again, we think it's a great opportunity also And probably in terms of an approval there, not really banking on that approval from a sales perspective this year Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI Congrats on the strong print this morning Robert, maybe one high-level question on the base business here I think there are some confusion this morning On the base ex COVID rate versus pre-pandemic 2019 levels, I think you did 11% in 2Q and that was maybe perhaps low double digits in Q1 So the question I think people are asking is, if we had sequential improvements, is 11% versus 10%, that seems a little light\", 'Sentiment': 'Neutral'}, (2, 16): {'Text': \" But I think that kind of ignores the business mix Maybe perhaps can you talk about what's happening to device business? What was the sequential acceleration? And what is baked in for the back half? Should we continue to see some benefit from backlog and further acceleration? Sure I mean I think the Med Device kind of grew again, Q2 versus 2021 That growth rate has been increasing and has been sequentially improving, as I said, in the first question Obviously, the recovery is not uniform across all businesses So if you look at our device portfolio, one of the parts of the portfolio that we've seen a little bit of a lagging recovery here has been in Neuromodulation, where I'd characterize that as a little bit even more elective than some of the other procedures And we've seen, say, like a little bit of a slower recovery trend in that business versus, say, for example, a Structural Heart, an EP or a Diabetes business\\r\\nSimilar to Diagnostics, our immunoassay and clinical chemistry business, that's growing high single digits in the second quarter versus the second quarter of 2019, and that's an improvement versus where we were in Q1 One of the issues that we see in our Diagnostic businesses, we're seeing a slower recovery in kind of blood donations and that obviously impacts our transfusion business So kind of similar to neuro on the diagnostic side, seen a little of a slower recovery But I'd say those businesses that were more impacted by COVID in Q2 of last year, I'd say they've largely kind of recovered very well, very nicely, and we expect that trend to continue in the second half That's helpful And then maybe one on the product side on CardioMEMS We did some work\", 'Sentiment': 'Neutral'}, (2, 17): {'Text': \" It looks like it's an interesting trial It's a pretty large trial, I think, 3,600 patients enrolled, that's fairly large I guess assuming some of these results, if they were to mimic CHAMPION or the original trial in terms of reduction in heart failure hospitalizations I think mortality is an endpoint here Should CardioMEMS be a multibillion-dollar product for Abbott? The reason I'm asking is historical adoption trends have been quite slow, but your investments in such a large trial suggests some optimism So I'm curious how you guys are thinking about the longer-term opportunity Sure I mean I think a lot of these device segments that we see kind of large opportunities I think the key thing here is to make sure that you put the clinical evidence to be able to kind of create a strong kind of market development approach here And when we looked at CardioMEMS at the time back in 2017, where there were some issues with reimbursement in CMS, ascertaining the max kind of worth reimbursing, et cetera And you had positive CHAMPION's data\\r\\nI'm aware of some of the perceived shortcomings of that trial, but there is also plenty of real-world evidence showing similar benefits and similar results that you had observed in CHAMPION So we looked at this and we believe that this was a significant opportunity in the cardiovascular space We believe that monitoring pulmonary arterial pressure is a great indicator for prevention of acute heart failure and decided to make the investment in a larger trial to either address the perceived shortcomings of CHAMPION or -- and/or augment the data set\", 'Sentiment': 'Positive'}, (2, 18): {'Text': \"\\r\\nSo I'm hesitant to put a number around here, Vijay But I think the viewpoint here is that this is an opportunity as we're building our Heart Failure portfolio together with our LVAD portfolio and even with MitraClip, quite frankly, to really have a comprehensive suite of solutions for it And I think this is going to be an opportunity that we will be intentional about investing, whether it's trial, whether it's clinical and field-based teams to drive it We think the opportunity to expand the label to a Class II and Class IV presents a significant opportunity for us to expand the market and also the indication here to include CardioMEMS with elevated levels of BNP So I think that this is a great opportunity \\r\\nI guess your comment on mortality, I think that's important, but I also know, in talking to health systems, that hospitalization and reduction in hospitalization is still very important Some can argue that maybe you're just kicking the can down the road But I think that if you look at and have conversations with the health care systems, they'll see this as an important reduction Any reduction of hospitalization for this patient population will be significantly important for them So bottom line, yes, I think this is a great opportunity for us and we're being intentional about our investment and making the right clinical evidence to support the adoption so that we can get to numbers that you're referencing or even bigger Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo Just 2 for me I'll start with Libre, Robert Just maybe at a high level, your thoughts on kind of the road map for Libre from here, given that you're closing in on $1 billion a quarter in sales\", 'Sentiment': 'Positive'}, (2, 19): {'Text': \" And more specifically, any update on the launch of Libre 3 in Europe and how delays at FDA might impact the timing of Libre 3 in the US And I had one follow-up Sure Listen, we had a real strong quarter, as you saw, and as you mentioned, approaching that $1 billion mark on a quarterly perspective, sales above 40% I think really important here, Larry, is the user base And this is a different kind of device business It's a -- we talked about it from a mass market opportunity versus other parts of our device portfolio that might be a little bit more, let's say, call it, nichey versus the size of Libre But the user base is super important because when you've got this kind of retention level that we're seeing on the product, so between 80% and 90-plus percent globally, it really looks more like a subscription-like model And when you're in that subscription-like model and you've got this recurring revenue, the user base is hugely important And I think that's a lot of our focus right here, as we talked about this mass market, is building the user base \\r\\nAnd I think we've done a really good job internationally and in the US But as we've talked about, okay, we've got 3\", 'Sentiment': 'Positive'}, (2, 20): {'Text': \"5 million users I've talked about numbers all the way up to 80 million users

road map perspective, we're not deviating from kind of how we thought about this, right, which is we will continue to provide superior technology, superior experience to the user, whether it's with the product, whether it's how they get the product and still a value proposition that makes sense for a mass adoption So that's all gone very well, and that will continue to go very well \\r\\nLibre 3, we launched it in, I'd say, in Germany at the beginning of the year here A lot of our focus in that launch, Larry, was just more to understand kind of our marketing messaging, our positioning with our existing portfolio, reactions from physicians and even look at how other users from other CGMs kind of reacted to it And it's basically surpassed my expectations as we went into that pilot launch And so we'll be now transitioning to full launch mode of Libre 3, where we've got approval Specifically in the US, obviously, it's understood that the backlog that exists in -- at the FDA regarding diabetes products And I'm not going to comment on kind of timing here or expectations, but just that we're very excited kind of to be able to bring Libre 3 to the US\", 'Sentiment': 'Positive'}, (2,

thoughts on capital allocation are evolving, given your strong balance sheet We know valuations are relatively high Are there areas where you think valuations look more attractive? And historically, the sweet spot for Abbott's been acquisitions in the $5 billion to $10 billion range Is that still the case? I mean, obviously, St Jude was an exception to that, but just curious to see how your thoughts are evolving on M&A Well, specifically on M&A, there's no change in thoughts there I mean I think rather than have a number tied to it, it's more about does it strategically fit? Do we think that we can execute and drive more value out of it? And that mindset hasn't changed independently of kind of dollar amount there We're obviously actively looking We constantly surveil and survey and pay attention and track What I can say is that we've been probably actively moderating much more than where we were back in 2017 But there are some pretty elevated valuations right now, and I'm not going to do anything here that's going to either dilute our profiles, our growth rates, et cetera\", 'Sentiment': 'Neutral'}, (2, 22): {'Text': \" And key driver here is, is it being strategic? \\r\\nI actually think a lot of opportunity we have from a capital allocation back to kind of how you started the question was we've got a lot of opportunity internally A lot of great returns that we can have with our capital as we deploy them to support these opportunities that we have in our pipeline, specifically regarding kind of manufacturing, kind of ramp-up in capacity, whether it's Libre, whether it's MitraClip, seeing an opportunity here with Adult Nutrition as we've seen kind of several years here of strong kind of double-digit growth in Nutrition So I think we've got a great opportunity to be able to provide a great return to our shareholders by looking at our internal opportunities also Our next question comes from Matt Taylor from UBS So I did want to ask one about COVID testing And we know your guidance for the year here implies lower sales in the last 2 quarters I was wondering if you could just give us any insight into the trends that you're seeing in testing, especially outside of the US where we have less visibility, so we can think about some of these different scenarios that you're baking into the guidance for the rest of the year Sure Well, about a month ago, we talked a lot about COVID testing here And I don't think, over the last 30 days, we've seen anything materially different I would say we continue to see some of that kind of lowered kind of testing volumes in the US\", 'Sentiment': 'Neutral'}, (2, 23): {'Text': \", whether it's PCR but probably a little bit more on the rapid side We did a little bit better than what we had forecasted for the second quarter, and that was largely driven by international markets Still about 80% of our sales are on the rapid side But we did see higher international sales And I'd say, yes, it's probably driven by delta variant A lot of those international sales are more, let's say, kind of tender-driven And we've got great visibility to where cases are rising and our positions in those markets\\r\\nAs a company, our relationships, our understanding of how health authorities in those countries are thinking about their testing And what I can say is we become -- we've definitely become a preferred supplier here because of our scale, our capacity, the quality of our products and our pricing So the question here is going to be, even with surges, are you going to see testing increase? I think we will I think we will see some of that The question will be, geographically, where are we going to see it more?

Yes Like at a high level, I would say, yes, we're seeing kind of that same kind of recovery trend, again, within its own kind of segment Our immunoassay and clinical chemistry business, which represents about 80% of our core lab business, that actually was up high single digits in Q2 versus Q2 of 2019 So we are seeing that recovery on the core lab There are some assays that haven't recovered as much What we've seen here in the US is that we're seeing post-surgery policies here from certain hospitals do less overnight stays So when you're doing that, you're getting a little bit less of that But I'd say that's offset with higher share gain and growth in new accounts with the rollout of Alinity So we're seeing that kind of high single digit\\r\\nAnd as you mentioned, the issue is really kind of low donation, blood donations that are impacting our transfusion business, which we've got 65%, 60-plus percent market share So we're hoping to see -- we've been working with different agencies here to kind of bring awareness to this fact here because, obviously, there's inventory of blood\", 'Sentiment': 'Neutral'}, (2, 25): {'Text': \" But if this rate of donations continues, then it will be a challenge for the US So hopefully, we'll start to see that recover here as we get towards the end of the year Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank It's really 2 questions The first one is a follow-up on what Bob was asking earlier on, is there anything that you can give us on 2022? I'm getting a lot of questions as it relates to margins, COVID, double-digit EPS So anything on a framework basis that would be helpful I'd appreciate it Sure Listen, we've talked about this a couple of times on a couple of calls already, and I just think it's a little bit too early to kind of provide that forecast given there's so many different kind of moving parts We're starting our process right now But I don't think the framework changes versus what we've talked about, which is our underlying business, so excluding COVID testing, it will clearly be very well positioned for very strong growth, top line and bottom line just based on the trends that we're seeing, based on the pipeline, the new products that we have in the pipeline that we have in place So our underlying base business will clearly be set up for very strong top and bottom line growth\\r\\nWe've obviously got to look at COVID testing, and that's a factor here\", 'Sentiment': 'Neutral'}, (2, 26): {'Text': \" We talked about it last call It'll be probably not very prudent here to assume a significant amount of COVID testing Now if there's going to be demand of COVID testing, we've got plenty of capacity to meet it, and that's ultimately going to be kind of the factor here As I said, we're going to start to kind of lap a little bit of this testing in Q3 and Q4 of this year We've obviously had a real strong Q1 also So that obviously has an impact And then having to look at our spend and modulate our spend here, but in a way that doesn't detract from our kind of long-term sustainable kind of growth even past 2022, 2023 So we've got a lot of good momentum, a lot of ongoing and upcoming launch activity and I want to make sure that I capitalize on the positions and the opportunities that we've built upon And then I've heard the word pipeline investment a couple of times there Other than some of the names that we've -- or products that we've already focused on, such as Amulet, CardioMEMS and Libre 3, are there other products in the pipeline that you'd like to draw our attention to? Yes, sure Listen, if you look at Structural Heart, I think there's 2 kind of really good opportunities for us over here TAVR with bringing the product to the US and the launch of our second-generation product in Navitor in Europe\", 'Sentiment': 'Neutral'}, (2, 27): {'Text': \" I mean these are 2 opportunities that we have We know our position and we know the choices and the strategy that we'll take as we enter this market here in the US, and I think it's great It will be a great opportunity for us \\r\\nAnd then the second product on Structural Heart is our tricuspid repair system It's a great opportunity It's got a potential kind of billion-dollar market opportunity for it We've done very well with it, actually Right now, our sales have kind of annualized right now on a $100 million basis, and we launched this in the middle of pandemic last year So I think that's a great near-term opportunity \\r\\nAnd then on CRM, we've made the investment here to get our leadless program back on track here regarding a single chamber and then making the investment on a dual chamber And I think that's another kind of big opportunity that we'll have to continue our kind of growth recovery in our CRM So we're targeting to enter this market next year, again, with a single chamber and then build off there\", 'Sentiment': 'Positive'}, (2, 28): {'Text': \" So I think we've got great opportunity in the device space\\r\\nAnd then in the Diagnostics is the continuing of building the menu, the assays, the menu of assays We're obviously making investments in our rapid business to capitalize on the  placements that we've made for ID NOW with COVID to be able to kind of not only drive flu, but other respiratory viruses that we think will be opportunity for us also But I think those are probably more the near term, ie, next kind of 12, 18 months and then a larger pipeline after that And our last question comes from Josh Jennings from Cowen Robert, just wanted to ask a multipart question on just duopolies in the US market You're about to create one with the entrance at Amulet And then down the line, you'll be in a different position as the first mover in the duopoly being created by a competitor coming into the edge-to-edge mitral repair market And I was hoping if you could just give us your views on US\", 'Sentiment': 'Positive'}, (2, 29): {'Text': \" duopolies in terms of second player coming into the market, catalyzing market growth, how you think about that, the risk for competitive pricing to ensue and then the potential for that second mover to capture share and where those can lay out Sure I mean generally speaking, competition will always kind of drive further innovation, further investment So one can kind of make the analysis here that when you're -- when you have a competitor coming into your segment, you'll do more to invest in the business and that investment will then drive the category So I think on one side, I do believe in that, and I think you can see how that's kind of had an impact Definitely, when we came into the US with Libre and kind of what happened to that market and what happened to the technology in terms of kind of making all the technologies better and et cetera So the flip side of that is competition is -- you could potentially see, I guess, price as a lever to drive demand or to drive share capture We've tried to focus every time we're entering markets with a value proposition that sustains our price and our pricing strategy and focus on the benefits that our solution will bring\\r\\nAnd so I think you've got these 2 parts of kind of competition in markets I'd say that's probably true for a 2-player market or a 3-player market So -- but listen, we're excited to come into the LAA market here in the US\", 'Sentiment': 'Neutral'}, (2, 30): {'Text': \" We're obviously a player internationally and we're making the investments So for example, we've already begun our investment in market expansion in LAA with our CATALYST trial, which is comparing  our product to NOAC, which is the standard of care And I know that competitors are making kind of similar clinical investment I think that's good I think that's positive \\r\\nOkay So that being said, I'd say here, if I just kind of sum up, our results clearly demonstrated here that we're showing real strong growth across all of our businesses, devices, Diagnostics, our Established Pharmaceutical business and our Nutrition And as I said in the beginning of the call, as we look to the second half of the year, we expect that growth to continue in our underlying business I think to Joanne's question, maybe to Bob's question also, optically, you're going to see a little bit of this, I'd say, artificial fog or lapping here or a comp versus for a few quarters as we kind of go through these sales that we've had from this big role that we played in COVID testing during the pandemic\\r\\nBut I don't let that cloud kind of how we think about the business and how we think about the business long term And I think our forecast here shows that we'll have a pretty differentiated underlying base business performance here Our pipeline is highly productive, we've got a lot of ongoing launch activity and there's even more on the way here So we're very excited about that, and we're investing across our key growth platforms So we're feeling really good about our underlying base business and the momentum that we've got\", 'Sentiment': 'Positive'}, (2, 31): {'Text': \" So thanks for joining us today Thank you, operator, and thank you for

These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available at our website at abbott.com. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary for sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange. \\r\\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Robert. Thanks, Scott. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported results of a very strong quarter. Ongoing earnings per share were $1.17, reflecting more than 100% growth compared to the prior year. Sales increased 35% on an organic basis in the quarter compared to last year. \\r\\nGiven the significant negative impact COVID had on demand for elective medical procedures and routine diagnostic testing last year, comparing sales versus pre-pandemic levels of 2019 provides one of the more relevant measures of performance. On this comparison, excluding sales from our COVID testing business, organic sales grew nearly 11.5% in the second quarter, driven by strong sales growth across all 4 of our major businesses, including double-digit growth in Established Pharmaceuticals, Nutrition and Medical Devices. \\r\\nI'll now summarize our second quarter results before turning over the call to Bob. And I'll start with Nutrition, where sales increased 9.5% compared to last year. Strong growth in the quarter was led by mid-teens growth in Adult Nutrition, including more than 20% growth internationally.\\r\\nSince the beginning of the pandemic, we've seen 2 factors positively impact Adult Nutrition demand: new users are entering the category and existing customers have increased their usage. And as the global market leader, these dynamics are driving strong growth for our Ensure and Glucerna brands. \\r\\nIn Pediatric Nutrition, sales grew nearly 4.5% in the quarter, led by growth of nearly 9% in the U.S., where we continue to capture share with our leading portfolio of infant formula and toddler brands. Sales of Pedialyte, our global rehydration brand, grew strong double digits, driven by recently launched new products and increased investments we're making in direct-to-consumer promotion. \\r\\nTurning to Diagnostics. Sales increased more than 55%, which includes $1.3 billion of COVID testing-related sales. Excluding COVID testing-related sales, underlying Diagnostics sales increased 37% compared to last year. Strong sales growth in our underlying Diagnostic business is being driven by improving routine diagnostic testing as health care systems continue to recover from the pandemic as well as the continued rollout of our Alinity platforms. Excluding COVID testing-related sales, second quarter sales in Core Laboratory and Molecular Diagnostics grew mid-single digits compared to pre-pandemic levels in the second quarter of 2019. \\r\\nMoving to Established Pharmaceuticals, where sales grew nearly 15% in the quarter. Strong sales performance in the quarter was broad-based across several countries, including double-digit growth in India, China, Russia and Brazil, which led to overall sales growth of nearly 18.5% in our key emerging markets. While we continue to see COVID cases surge in several emerging markets, including the recent surge in India, our team is executing at a high level to meet market demand for our medicines.\\r\\nAnd lastly, I'll cover Medical Devices, where sales grew 45% in the quarter compared to last year and more than 15.5% compared to the second quarter of 2019. Strong growth in the quarter was led by Structural Heart, Electrophysiology, Heart Failure and Diabetes Care, all of which grew double digits compared to the second quarter of 2019. In Structural Heart, we achieved the highest number of MitraClip procedures ever in the second quarter, including a record number of procedures in the month of June. \\r\\nNow I'll wrap up with Diabetes Care, where strong growth was led by FreeStyle Libre sales of more than $900 million. The global user base for Libre grew to approximately 3.5 million users, including approximately 1 million users in the U.S., driven by market expansion and awareness efforts as well as ongoing new product launch activity in every major market around the world. \\r\\nSo in summary, we're achieving strong growth across all 4 of our major businesses, particularly pleased with the strong momentum and growth contributions we're seeing from several recently launched products and investments we're making in our key growth platforms. And our new product pipeline continues to be incredibly productive, delivering a steady cadence of new products with more to come over the next several months. \\r\\nI'll now turn over the call to Bob to discuss our results and outlook for the full year in more detail. Bob? Thanks, Robert. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance. \\r\\nTurning to our results. Sales for the second quarter increased 35% on an organic basis, which was led by strong performance across all of our businesses. Excluding COVID testing-related sales, organic sales growth was 29% versus last year and nearly 11.5% compared to the second quarter of 2019. Foreign exchange had a favorable year-over-year impact of 4.5% on second quarter sales, resulting in total reported sales growth of 39.5% in the quarter. \\r\\nRegarding other aspects of the P&L for the quarter, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 56.9% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 6.2% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 25.8% of sales. \\r\\nOur second quarter adjusted tax rate was 14.4%, which reflects an adjustment to align our year-to-date tax rate with our revised full year effective tax rate forecast of 14.7%. The revised full year forecast is modestly lower than the estimate we provided in January due to a shift in the mix of our business and geographic income. \\r\\nTurning to our outlook for the full year 2021. Our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $4.30 to $4.50 remains unchanged and  reflects strong double-digit growth compared to last year and approximately 35% growth at the midpoint compared to our pre-pandemic adjusted earnings per share in 2019. \\r\\nWe continue to forecast $4 billion to $4.5 billion in COVID testing-related sales for the full year 2021. And based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have a favorable impact of around 2% on our full year 2021 sales. \\r\\nTurning to the outlook for the third quarter. We forecast adjusted earnings per share of at least $0.90, which reflects continued strong growth and momentum in our core underlying business and a sequential step-down in COVID testing-related sales compared to the second quarter. And based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have a favorable impact of around 1% on our third quarter reported sales. \\r\\nWith that, we'll now open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. I'll keep my questions quick and high level. First, for Robert, I'm just curious on your view on the pace of the recovery in surgical procedures generally. Is it kind of continued throughout the quarter and into July? Or are you starting to see signs of the spread of variants could cause a little lumpiness in the pace of the recovery? Just wanted to get your views on how things are going. Sure. Listen, we obviously had a very strong quarter in terms of recovery. I mean we had planned to see that recovery in the U.S. and in Europe and in certain Asian markets, and that recovery has largely played out the way we had anticipated. I'd say probably a little bit better even than what we thought. I don't think what we're seeing here with relating to like increase in COVID cases, I don't think that you'll see the same -- or at least we're not seeing the same kind of impact in terms of hospitals shutting procedures down, stopping testing, et cetera. I think it's a very different situation where we are this year versus where we are last year, even though if you look at the case, global case counts, they're pretty much in line to where we were in October last year. We've got therapeutics. We've got vaccines. We've got testing. So we're not seeing that. \\r\\nOn the device side, listen, our business has done very well. Overall, as I said in my comments, we're up double digits, mid-teens versus the second quarter largely driven by EP, Heart Failure, Structural Heart, Diabetes, as I said. And actually, if you look at the cardiovascular-specific recovery, we exited the first quarter at about a 2% growth versus March of 2019. And then if you look at the second quarter, our June growth rate was around about 7% versus June of 2019. So we're seeing this kind of sequential recovery in the procedures as evidenced by our growth rates in our procedures. And we were looking at data yesterday, the first couple of weeks of July are showing that same trajectory, whether it's in the U.S. or whether it's outside the U.S., generally. Obviously, there are some markets that have different kind of trends and paces. But I'd say, overall, we're seeing that recovery. And that's how we're looking at the rest of the year, Bob, is that continued trajectory in terms of recovery in procedures and diagnostic testing. Okay. That's really helpful. And then my second question for Bob. I'd love you to comment on 2 things, if okay. One, just you had a nice EPS beat relative to consensus and really relative to the way you guys just guiding the quarter. But you're leaving guidance the same. Just wanted to understand that dynamic. Why not boost the EPS a little bit? \\r\\nAnd then secondly, if you -- just curious if you think consensus estimates, as we look forward a little bit, are kind of reflecting the way you guys are viewing the world right now. And obviously, I'm specifically talking about next year. So any preliminary thoughts on whether consensus is sort of capturing the world as you see it? And wondering just about the EPS guidance for this year. Yes. Bob, I'll take the first question on the guidance for this year. Clearly, about 1/3 of that beat was due to the little higher COVID sales than we have projected. Obviously, forecasting COVID is quite challenging. And so that was about 1/3 of beat. About 2/3 really was better performance in the base business versus how The Street had modeled that. And so the way we look at it, we gave a pretty wide range on earnings guidance back at the beginning of June. And that really kind of accounts for any kind of fluctuations or changes in the COVID testing in the back half of this year as well as kind of underlying base business performance. So we feel really comfortable about the range we have and feel that kind of captures different scenarios around COVID testing. Bob, on the question of consensus for the rest of the year, I mean, I think this is how we're thinking about the second half of the year. Obviously, from a top line perspective, we're going to have to lap some of our COVID sales that we had in Q3 and Q4. Obviously, if you looked at last year, that was really the height of our ramp-up in COVID sales. But the underlying business, excluding COVID sales, will be getting sequentially better every quarter. So we're looking at our base underlying business growing low double digits for the rest of the year. \\r\\nFrom a gross margin perspective, we'll see expansion in gross margin versus where we were in Q2. There's obviously maybe some friction on some input costs, commodities, freight, et cetera, the team works hard to kind of offset those. So we'll see improvement also as the base business recovers and the margin profiles from that recovery expand. \\r\\nAnd we'll continue to make the ramp-up of investments that we talked about from an R&D and SG&A perspective. Some of those investments have a faster and more, I'd say, kind of more immediate return. So for example, direct-to-consumer advertising in Nutrition or Libre, for example, and some of those investments are a little bit more medium term, whether it's R&D programs or whether it's kind of getting ready for upcoming launches.\\r\\nSo the real, I'd say, kind of factor here becomes COVID testing. And we gave guidance about a month ago about $4 billion to $4.5 billion. After the 2 quarters, we're about $3 billion, $3.5 billion. So we've got between $0.5 billion and $1 billion to go in the next 6 months. And I think that's really the question here is how will testing play itself out in the next kind of second half year, whether it's variants, whether it's vaccination rates, et cetera. So that's just something that we're paying attention. And as Bob said, that's why our guidance range was pretty wide, which is really to account for that. Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Great. Congrats on a good quarter. Bob, maybe to follow up on the last question. There's a lot of moving pieces down the P&L right now. You had a really good operating margin in the quarter. I was just wondering if you could update us on the latest on how you're thinking of reinvestment of COVID testing revenues, how that's flowing through the P&L. And if you have any preliminary thoughts on the impact or benefit it might add to next year as people think about their models now. In terms of investment, Robbie, if you look at our SG&A and R&D combined, we're up around $700 million versus the prior year. And we expect to kind of sustain pretty strong investment in the base business. So we have, as you know, reinvested some of those COVID testing sale profits back into the base business to drive growth going forward. As you say, we had a really healthy operating margin profile in the second quarter. We're going to see some impact on that operating margin profile the rest of the year with the step-down in those COVID testing sales in the back half of this year. That's going to obviously have some impact on our operating margin profile while we sustain a lot of that investment, in particular, in the R&D and SG&A spaces to drive growth the rest of the year and into next year. Great. And maybe just a quick follow-up. We have some -- coming back to new product launches and clinical data sets. We have 2 interesting ones coming at ESC later in August with CardioMEMS and with Amulet. I was just hoping we could get the latest thoughts on approval timing, product launch potential and how we should think about near-term expectations for product launches, given the COVID environment is still impacting hospitals to a degree. Sure. On Amulet, we talked about this, right, Robbie. We filed with the FDA late last year. We -- right now, we plan to present the data at ESC. So that's kind of in the late August time frame. We think it's, again, an attractive market, great opportunity for growth for us. The product is available in Europe and in those markets, albeit a smaller market than the U.S. We have a 50% market share. So we feel very good about our ability here to compete with the product we have. \\r\\nRegarding timing, it's one of those I can't give you an exact timing. It's definitely, we think, kind of in the second half. And then it's just going to depend in terms of impact this year versus next year. Obviously, the impact next year is larger. And that's just going to depend on when the approval hits this year. Obviously, if it's more towards the back end of the year, then we'll see less of an impact. If it's sooner, that will be an opportunity for us here to execute on that.\\r\\nOn CardioMEMS, I guess, similar. We think this is another great opportunity. I mean, both these products were products when we began the St. Jude integration, both of these products were trials that we really wanted to invest in and drive on the clinical evidence and driving the clinical evidence of these 2 products. So it's great to see we're in a position now to be able to kind of disclose and share the data from these trials that we put together. We filed our label expansion with the FDA on CardioMEMS this second quarter, more towards the end of the second quarter. And again, we think it's a great opportunity also. And probably in terms of an approval there, not really banking on that approval from a sales perspective this year. Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Congrats on the strong print this morning. Robert, maybe one high-level question on the base business here. I think there are some confusion this morning. On the base ex COVID rate versus pre-pandemic 2019 levels, I think you did 11% in 2Q and that was maybe perhaps low double digits in Q1. So the question I think people are asking is, if we had sequential improvements, is 11% versus 10%, that seems a little light. But I think that kind of ignores the business mix. Maybe perhaps can you talk about what's happening to device business? What was the sequential acceleration? And what is baked in for the back half? Should we continue to see some benefit from backlog and further acceleration? Sure. I mean I think the Med Device kind of grew again, Q2 versus 2021. That growth rate has been increasing and has been sequentially improving, as I said, in the first question. Obviously, the recovery is not uniform across all businesses. So if you look at our device portfolio, one of the parts of the portfolio that we've seen a little bit of a lagging recovery here has been in Neuromodulation, where I'd characterize that as a little bit even more elective than some of the other procedures. And we've seen, say, like a little bit of a slower recovery trend in that business versus, say, for example, a Structural Heart, an EP or a Diabetes business.\\r\\nSimilar to Diagnostics, our immunoassay and clinical chemistry business, that's growing high single digits in the second quarter versus the second quarter of 2019, and that's an improvement versus where we were in Q1. One of the issues that we see in our Diagnostic businesses, we're seeing a slower recovery in kind of blood donations and that obviously impacts our transfusion business. So kind of similar to neuro on the diagnostic side, seen a little of a slower recovery. But I'd say those businesses that were more impacted by COVID in Q2 of last year, I'd say they've largely kind of recovered very well, very nicely, and we expect that trend to continue in the second half. That's helpful. And then maybe one on the product side on CardioMEMS. We did some work. It looks like it's an interesting trial. It's a pretty large trial, I think, 3,600 patients enrolled, that's fairly large. I guess assuming some of these results, if they were to mimic CHAMPION or the original trial in terms of reduction in heart failure hospitalizations. I think mortality is an endpoint here. Should CardioMEMS be a multibillion-dollar product for Abbott? The reason I'm asking is historical adoption trends have been quite slow, but your investments in such a large trial suggests some optimism. So I'm curious how you guys are thinking about the longer-term opportunity. Sure. I mean I think a lot of these device segments that we see kind of large opportunities. I think the key thing here is to make sure that you put the clinical evidence to be able to kind of create a strong kind of market development approach here. And when we looked at CardioMEMS at the time back in 2017, where there were some issues with reimbursement in CMS, ascertaining the max kind of worth reimbursing, et cetera. And you had positive CHAMPION's data.\\r\\nI'm aware of some of the perceived shortcomings of that trial, but there is also plenty of real-world evidence showing similar benefits and similar results that you had observed in CHAMPION. So we looked at this and we believe that this was a significant opportunity in the cardiovascular space. We believe that monitoring pulmonary arterial pressure is a great indicator for prevention of acute heart failure and decided to make the investment in a larger trial to either address the perceived shortcomings of CHAMPION or -- and/or augment the data set.\\r\\nSo I'm hesitant to put a number around here, Vijay. But I think the viewpoint here is that this is an opportunity as we're building our Heart Failure portfolio together with our LVAD portfolio and even with MitraClip, quite frankly, to really have a comprehensive suite of solutions for it. And I think this is going to be an opportunity that we will be intentional about investing, whether it's trial, whether it's clinical and field-based teams to drive it. We think the opportunity to expand the label to a Class II and Class IV presents a significant opportunity for us to expand the market and also the indication here to include CardioMEMS with elevated levels of BNP. So I think that this is a great opportunity. \\r\\nI guess your comment on mortality, I think that's important, but I also know, in talking to health systems, that hospitalization and reduction in hospitalization is still very important. Some can argue that maybe you're just kicking the can down the road. But I think that if you look at and have conversations with the health care systems, they'll see this as an important reduction. Any reduction of hospitalization for this patient population will be significantly important for them. So bottom line, yes, I think this is a great opportunity for us and we're being intentional about our investment and making the right clinical evidence to support the adoption so that we can get to numbers that you're referencing or even bigger. Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Just 2 for me. I'll start with Libre, Robert. Just maybe at a high level, your thoughts on kind of the road map for Libre from here, given that you're closing in on $1 billion a quarter in sales. And more specifically, any update on the launch of Libre 3 in Europe and how delays at FDA might impact the timing of Libre 3 in the U.S. And I had one follow-up. Sure. Listen, we had a real strong quarter, as you saw, and as you mentioned, approaching that $1 billion mark on a quarterly perspective, sales above 40%. I think really important here, Larry, is the user base. And this is a different kind of device business. It's a -- we talked about it from a mass market opportunity versus other parts of our device portfolio that might be a little bit more, let's say, call it, nichey versus the size of Libre. But the user base is super important because when you've got this kind of retention level that we're seeing on the product, so between 80% and 90-plus percent globally, it really looks more like a subscription-like model. And when you're in that subscription-like model and you've got this recurring revenue, the user base is hugely important. And I think that's a lot of our focus right here, as we talked about this mass market, is building the user base. \\r\\nAnd I think we've done a really good job internationally and in the U.S. But as we've talked about, okay, we've got 3.5 million users. I've talked about numbers all the way up to 80 million users potential for this product once you aggregate insulin users and type 2s, et cetera. So I think this is a real strong growth opportunity for us, and we're still in the early innings, as I've said. From a road map perspective, we're not deviating from kind of how we thought about this, right, which is we will continue to provide superior technology, superior experience to the user, whether it's with the product, whether it's how they get the product and still a value proposition that makes sense for a mass adoption. So that's all gone very well, and that will continue to go very well. \\r\\nLibre 3, we launched it in, I'd say, in Germany at the beginning of the year here. A lot of our focus in that launch, Larry, was just more to understand kind of our marketing messaging, our positioning with our existing portfolio, reactions from physicians and even look at how other users from other CGMs kind of reacted to it. And it's basically surpassed my expectations as we went into that pilot launch. And so we'll be now transitioning to full launch mode of Libre 3, where we've got approval. Specifically in the U.S., obviously, it's understood that the backlog that exists in -- at the FDA regarding diabetes products. And I'm not going to comment on kind of timing here or expectations, but just that we're very excited kind of to be able to bring Libre 3 to the U.S. also and augment our portfolio with the product. That's helpful, Robert. And just lastly for me. I know I've asked about this on a few earnings calls, but I'm just curious how your thoughts on capital allocation are evolving, given your strong balance sheet. We know valuations are relatively high. Are there areas where you think valuations look more attractive? And historically, the sweet spot for Abbott's been acquisitions in the $5 billion to $10 billion range. Is that still the case? I mean, obviously, St. Jude was an exception to that, but just curious to see how your thoughts are evolving on M&A. Well, specifically on M&A, there's no change in thoughts there. I mean I think rather than have a number tied to it, it's more about does it strategically fit? Do we think that we can execute and drive more value out of it? And that mindset hasn't changed independently of kind of dollar amount there. We're obviously actively looking. We constantly surveil and survey and pay attention and track. What I can say is that we've been probably actively moderating much more than where we were back in 2017. But there are some pretty elevated valuations right now, and I'm not going to do anything here that's going to either dilute our profiles, our growth rates, et cetera. And key driver here is, is it being strategic? \\r\\nI actually think a lot of opportunity we have from a capital allocation back to kind of how you started the question was we've got a lot of opportunity internally. A lot of great returns that we can have with our capital as we deploy them to support these opportunities that we have in our pipeline, specifically regarding kind of manufacturing, kind of ramp-up in capacity, whether it's Libre, whether it's MitraClip, seeing an opportunity here with Adult Nutrition as we've seen kind of several years here of strong kind of double-digit growth in Nutrition. So I think we've got a great opportunity to be able to provide a great return to our shareholders by looking at our internal opportunities also. Our next question comes from Matt Taylor from UBS. So I did want to ask one about COVID testing. And we know your guidance for the year here implies lower sales in the last 2 quarters. I was wondering if you could just give us any insight into the trends that you're seeing in testing, especially outside of the U.S. where we have less visibility, so we can think about some of these different scenarios that you're baking into the guidance for the rest of the year. Sure. Well, about a month ago, we talked a lot about COVID testing here. And I don't think, over the last 30 days, we've seen anything materially different. I would say we continue to see some of that kind of lowered kind of testing volumes in the U.S., whether it's PCR but probably a little bit more on the rapid side. We did a little bit better than what we had forecasted for the second quarter, and that was largely driven by international markets. Still about 80% of our sales are on the rapid side. But we did see higher international sales. And I'd say, yes, it's probably driven by delta variant. A lot of those international sales are more, let's say, kind of tender-driven. And we've got great visibility to where cases are rising and our positions in those markets.\\r\\nAs a company, our relationships, our understanding of how health authorities in those countries are thinking about their testing. And what I can say is we become -- we've definitely become a preferred supplier here because of our scale, our capacity, the quality of our products and our pricing. So the question here is going to be, even with surges, are you going to see testing increase? I think we will. I think we will see some of that. The question will be, geographically, where are we going to see it more? And I think geographically, we'll see more internationally than, at least what I think right now, than what we'll see in the United States from a back half perspective. Got it. And maybe I could just ask one follow-up on recovery in Diagnostics versus med tech. So I know you called out this issue with blood donations. And I guess, excluding that, would you think about the recovery in your core diagnostics business, ex COVID, similar to med tech, should it go in lockstep? Or is there going to be a difference there for some reason? Could you flesh out the blood donation headwind? How much is that? Yes. Like at a high level, I would say, yes, we're seeing kind of that same kind of recovery trend, again, within its own kind of segment. Our immunoassay and clinical chemistry business, which represents about 80% of our core lab business, that actually was up high single digits in Q2 versus Q2 of 2019. So we are seeing that recovery on the core lab. There are some assays that haven't recovered as much. What we've seen here in the U.S. is that we're seeing post-surgery policies here from certain hospitals do less overnight stays. So when you're doing that, you're getting a little bit less of that. But I'd say that's offset with higher share gain and growth in new accounts with the rollout of Alinity. So we're seeing that kind of high single digit.\\r\\nAnd as you mentioned, the issue is really kind of low donation, blood donations that are impacting our transfusion business, which we've got 65%, 60-plus percent market share. So we're hoping to see -- we've been working with different agencies here to kind of bring awareness to this fact here because, obviously, there's inventory of blood. But if this rate of donations continues, then it will be a challenge for the U.S. So hopefully, we'll start to see that recover here as we get towards the end of the year. Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. It's really 2 questions. The first one is a follow-up on what Bob was asking earlier on, is there anything that you can give us on 2022? I'm getting a lot of questions as it relates to margins, COVID, double-digit EPS. So anything on a framework basis that would be helpful. I'd appreciate it. Sure. Listen, we've talked about this a couple of times on a couple of calls already, and I just think it's a little bit too early to kind of provide that forecast given there's so many different kind of moving parts. We're starting our process right now. But I don't think the framework changes versus what we've talked about, which is our underlying business, so excluding COVID testing, it will clearly be very well positioned for very strong growth, top line and bottom line just based on the trends that we're seeing, based on the pipeline, the new products that we have in the pipeline that we have in place. So our underlying base business will clearly be set up for very strong top and bottom line growth.\\r\\nWe've obviously got to look at COVID testing, and that's a factor here. We talked about it last call. It'll be probably not very prudent here to assume a significant amount of COVID testing. Now if there's going to be demand of COVID testing, we've got plenty of capacity to meet it, and that's ultimately going to be kind of the factor here. As I said, we're going to start to kind of lap a little bit of this testing in Q3 and Q4 of this year. We've obviously had a real strong Q1 also. So that obviously has an impact. And then having to look at our spend and modulate our spend here, but in a way that doesn't detract from our kind of long-term sustainable kind of growth even past 2022, 2023. So we've got a lot of good momentum, a lot of ongoing and upcoming launch activity and I want to make sure that I capitalize on the positions and the opportunities that we've built upon. And then I've heard the word pipeline investment a couple of times there. Other than some of the names that we've -- or products that we've already focused on, such as Amulet, CardioMEMS and Libre 3, are there other products in the pipeline that you'd like to draw our attention to? Yes, sure. Listen, if you look at Structural Heart, I think there's 2 kind of really good opportunities for us over here. TAVR with bringing the product to the U.S. and the launch of our second-generation product in Navitor in Europe. I mean these are 2 opportunities that we have. We know our position and we know the choices and the strategy that we'll take as we enter this market here in the U.S., and I think it's great. It will be a great opportunity for us. \\r\\nAnd then the second product on Structural Heart is our tricuspid repair system. It's a great opportunity. It's got a potential kind of billion-dollar market opportunity for it. We've done very well with it, actually. Right now, our sales have kind of annualized right now on a $100 million basis, and we launched this in the middle of pandemic last year. So I think that's a great near-term opportunity. \\r\\nAnd then on CRM, we've made the investment here to get our leadless program back on track here regarding a single chamber and then making the investment on a dual chamber. And I think that's another kind of big opportunity that we'll have to continue our kind of growth recovery in our CRM. So we're targeting to enter this market next year, again, with a single chamber and then build off there. So I think we've got great opportunity in the device space.\\r\\nAnd then in the Diagnostics is the continuing of building the menu, the assays, the menu of assays. We're obviously making investments in our rapid business to capitalize on the  placements that we've made for ID NOW with COVID to be able to kind of not only drive flu, but other respiratory viruses that we think will be opportunity for us also. But I think those are probably more the near term, i.e., next kind of 12, 18 months and then a larger pipeline after that. And our last question comes from Josh Jennings from Cowen. Robert, just wanted to ask a multipart question on just duopolies in the U.S. market. You're about to create one with the entrance at Amulet. And then down the line, you'll be in a different position as the first mover in the duopoly being created by a competitor coming into the edge-to-edge mitral repair market. And I was hoping if you could just give us your views on U.S. duopolies in terms of second player coming into the market, catalyzing market growth, how you think about that, the risk for competitive pricing to ensue and then the potential for that second mover to capture share and where those can lay out. Sure. I mean generally speaking, competition will always kind of drive further innovation, further investment. So one can kind of make the analysis here that when you're -- when you have a competitor coming into your segment, you'll do more to invest in the business and that investment will then drive the category. So I think on one side, I do believe in that, and I think you can see how that's kind of had an impact. Definitely, when we came into the U.S. with Libre and kind of what happened to that market and what happened to the technology in terms of kind of making all the technologies better and et cetera. So the flip side of that is competition is -- you could potentially see, I guess, price as a lever to drive demand or to drive share capture. We've tried to focus every time we're entering markets with a value proposition that sustains our price and our pricing strategy and focus on the benefits that our solution will bring.\\r\\nAnd so I think you've got these 2 parts of kind of competition in markets. I'd say that's probably true for a 2-player market or a 3-player market. So -- but listen, we're excited to come into the LAA market here in the U.S. We're obviously a player internationally and we're making the investments. So for example, we've already begun our investment in market expansion in LAA with our CATALYST trial, which is comparing  our product to NOAC, which is the standard of care. And I know that competitors are making kind of similar clinical investment. I think that's good. I think that's positive. \\r\\nOkay. So that being said, I'd say here, if I just kind of sum up, our results clearly demonstrated here that we're showing real strong growth across all of our businesses, devices, Diagnostics, our Established Pharmaceutical business and our Nutrition. And as I said in the beginning of the call, as we look to the second half of the year, we expect that growth to continue in our underlying business. I think to Joanne's question, maybe to Bob's question also, optically, you're going to see a little bit of this, I'd say, artificial fog or lapping here or a comp versus for a few quarters as we kind of go through these sales that we've had from this big role that we played in COVID testing during the pandemic.\\r\\nBut I don't let that cloud kind of how we think about the business and how we think about the business long term. And I think our forecast here shows that we'll have a pretty differentiated underlying base business performance here. Our pipeline is highly productive, we've got a lot of ongoing launch activity and there's even more on the way here. So we're very excited about that, and we're investing across our key growth platforms. So we're feeling really good about our underlying base business and the momentum that we've got. So thanks for joining us today. Thank you, operator, and thank you for all of your questions. That now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11 a.m. Central Time today on Abbott's Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank you for joining us today. Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.\",\n          \"Good morning, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Abbott's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participant's questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbot's expressed written permission.  \\r\\nI would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President, Investor Relations, Licensing and Acquisitions. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Funck, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Robert and Bob will provide opening remarks. Following their comments, we will take your questions.\\r\\nBefore we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2022. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law.  \\r\\nOn today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Note that Abbott has not provided the GAAP financial measure for organic sales growth on a forward-looking basis, because the company is unable to predict future changes in foreign exchange rates, which could impact reported sales growth. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange.  \\r\\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Robert. Thanks, Scott. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported results of another strong quarter. Earnings per share were $1.73, reflecting more than 30% growth compared to the prior year. Sales increased 17.5% on an organic basis in the quarter, led by double-digit growth in Medical Devices, Established Pharmaceuticals as well as Diagnostics, both with and without COVID testing-related sales.  \\r\\nIn addition to these strong results during the quarter, we continue to strengthen our strategic position and long-term growth opportunities with regulatory approvals of new products and expanded indications of use along with continued market uptake of several recently launched products in attractive growth areas.  \\r\\nI'll now summarize our first quarter results in more detail before turning the call over to Bob. And I'll start with Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, where sales increased 13.5% in the quarter. EPD has now achieved double-digit organic sales growth in 3 of the last 4 quarters. Strong performance this quarter was led by double-digit growth across several countries and core therapeutic areas, including gastroenterology, respiratory and CNS pain management.  \\r\\nTurning to Nutrition, where our performance was mixed. Our Adult Nutrition business continues to perform at a high level with global organic sales growth of 11.5%, led by our Ensure and Glucerna brands. And we also achieved double-digit growth globally in our combined toddler nutrition products, which includes our market-leading PediaSure and Pedialyte brands.  \\r\\nAs you know, however, we initiated a voluntary recall in February of certain infant formula products manufactured at one of our U.S. facilities. It's important to highlight as part of our quality system, we retain in-house samples of products that we ship to customers. Testing of retained samples related to this recall action by both Abbott and the FDA have all come back negative for the presence of the bacteria that cause the reported illnesses.  \\r\\nImportantly, the FDA and CDC found that there is no genetic match between the strains of the bacteria identified in nonproduct contact areas of our facility and available samples obtained from customer complaints, suggesting a different source of contamination.  \\r\\nAnd lastly, no salmonella was found in our factory or product and, therefore, the FDA ruled out any link to our facility. We hope these findings get parents, caregivers and other stakeholders renewed confidence in our products. We know the situation has further exacerbated industry-wide infant formula supply shortages. That's why we're doing everything possible to mitigate supply constraints by bringing in product from our FDA registered facility in Europe and ramping up production at our other U.S. plants. And of course, we're working very closely with the FDA on proactive actions and enhancements so that we can restart operations at the facility.  \\r\\nMoving to Diagnostics, where sales grew 35%. COVID test sales were $3.3 billion in the quarter, more than 90% of which came from our rapid test, including BinaxNOW in the U.S., Panbio internationally and ID NOW globally. Excluding COVID-related -- COVID testing-related sales, our Global Diagnostics sales grew 12% in the quarter, driven by the continued rollout of Alinity, our innovative suite of diagnostic instruments and expanding menus across our testing platforms.  \\r\\nAnd I'll wrap up with Medical Devices, where sales grew 11.5% in the quarter. This strong performance was led by double-digit growth in Diabetes Care, Structural Heart, Heart Failure and Electrophysiology. In Diabetes Care, sales of FreeStyle Libre grew more than 25% on an organic basis in the quarter and the user base has now reached approximately 4 million users globally. In Cardiovascular Devices, while procedure volumes were negatively impacted by elevated COVID case rates early in the year, we saw a steady improvement in procedure trends as the case rates came down in the second half of the quarter, which has continued into April.  \\r\\nIn addition to improving market trends and our strong results, this was also another highly productive quarter for our pipeline. In the U.S., we received FDA approval for Aveir, our leadless pacemaker to treat patients with slow heart rhythms. In Japan, expanded reimbursement for Libre will now cover all people with diabetes who use insulin at least once a day.  \\r\\nCardioMEMS received an expanded indication in the U.S. to treat more patients suffering from earlier stages of heart failure. And we received U.S. FDA clearance for the latest generation of our EnSite X system, which provides a 360-degree view of the heart for improved cardiac mapping.  \\r\\nSo in summary, we're achieving strong growth overall and across several areas of our business. As the first quarter progressed and COVID levels decreased, we saw a steady improvement in the hospital-based procedure trends, which has continued into April. And we continue to advance our pipeline with new products, indications and reimbursement coverage in several attractive growth areas.  \\r\\nI'll now turn over the call to Bob. Bob? Thanks, Robert. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange.  \\r\\nTurning to our results. Sales for the first quarter increased 17.5% on an organic basis, which was led by double-digit growth in Diagnostics, Medical Devices and Established Pharmaceuticals along with global COVID testing-related sales of $3.3 billion in the quarter.  \\r\\nExcluding COVID testing-related sales, organic sales growth was 7.7% versus the prior year.  \\r\\nForeign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 3.7% on first quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar continue to strengthen versus several currencies, which resulted in a more unfavorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in January.  \\r\\nRegarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 59.1% of sales, which reflects higher than normal fall-through on COVID testing sales as a result of significant production volumes during the first quarter, partially offset by the impacts of the nutrition recall and somewhat higher-than-expected inflation on certain manufacturing and distribution costs in the quarter.  \\r\\nAdjusted research and development investment was 5.6% of sales and adjusted SG&A investment was 23.1% of sales in the first quarter. Lastly, our first quarter adjusted tax rate was 14.5%.  \\r\\nBefore discussing our outlook for the full year, I want to provide an update on our strategic capital deployment initiatives completed in the first quarter, which included approximately $2.3 billion of share repurchases, $800 million of dividends, scheduled debt repayment of $750 million and $300 million of capital expenditures, which support future organic growth opportunities. We continue to generate strong cash flow, which provides the flexibility required to execute a well-balanced capital allocation strategy.  \\r\\nTurning to our outlook for the full year 2022. Our adjusted earnings per share guidance of at least $4.70 remains unchanged. We now forecast total company organic sales growth, excluding the impact of COVID testing-related sales, to be in the mid- to high single digits, which is somewhat lower than our prior forecast of high single digits due to the recent recall event in Nutrition. It is important to note, excluding sales impacted by the recall, we continue to forecast total organic sales growth in the high single digits for the remainder of our combined businesses, which includes Medical Devices, Established Pharmaceuticals, Diagnostics, excluding the impact of testing-related sales and areas of nutrition, not impacted by the recall.  \\r\\nWe forecast COVID testing-related sales of approximately $4.5 billion with a significant portion of these sales expected to occur in the first half of the year. We continue to -- we'll continue to update our COVID testing-related sales forecast 1 quarter at a time throughout the year as appropriate.  \\r\\nLastly, based on current rates, we would now expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of a little more than 3% on our full year reported sales.  \\r\\nWith that, we'll now open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Congrats on a good quarter. Maybe to start for Robert or Bob, you guys put up a good first quarter being on COVID testing sales had double-digit growth in most of the businesses. I was hoping maybe you can reconcile the strong 1Q and the reiterated guidance and walk us through some of the puts and takes and how to think about bridging the difference? Sure, Robbie. I think you've been on these calls for a while. We rarely raised in Q1, I would say. And despite that, I mean, we've had a great start to the year as pointed out. And there's a lot of good things going on at the company. We talked a little bit about procedure recovery in the comments. We've seen good recovery in our device portfolio, especially in cardiovascular, seen routine diagnostic testing improving albeit a little bit slower than what we've seen in devices, but definitely the trend of recovery is there. .\\r\\nEPD execution is going very well, like I said in the comments, 3 out of 4 quarters, double digit, strong COVID sales, both in the U.S. and internationally. I think that's an important aspect here is our international presence, too. Talked a little bit about the pipeline and the approvals, not just the recent approvals, but the performance of some of the recently launched products. Bob talked about our cash flow generation and the deployment of that cash flow. We're able to kind of share part of that cash flow with our shareholders, but also to continue to invest in the business. \\r\\nSo there's a lot of good things going on here in the business, and -- but there are a couple of challenges that we're managing, and that's probably the piece there where the reconciliation that you're looking for is actually happening. First of all, obviously managing through the recall on the nutrition side, we're working with the FDA. And we've contemplated in that reiterated guidance, various scenarios here in terms of kind of restart dates and share recovery curves, et cetera. So it's simple to give an exact date right now as to when that restart starts. We're working closely with the FDA, but I see this more as a shorter-term challenge in the sense that once we align with restarting with the FDA then we'll begin to execute our strategy here in terms of coming back to market, resupplying the market and regaining the share. \\r\\nProbably the second other part here, which is I think is a little bit not unique to Abbott. And I think you'll probably see this across a lot of companies is just the macro environment right now is -- has definitely changed versus where we were in January. And it's gotten a little bit more challenging. So -- and we expect some of that macro environment, whether it's supply chain, et cetera, to kind of be a little bit more persistent throughout this year. \\r\\nSo that being said, I wanted to see how these -- probably these 2 points here play out over the next couple of months, and we'll be in a better position to be able to assess that and on our guidance going forward after Q2. But like I said, there's a lot of great momentum in the business. Devices performing very well. Diagnostics performing very well. The parts of nutrition that weren't impacted by the recall continue to do very well.\\r\\nI'm not a big fan of the -- exclude this, but for that statement, but I think in the context of how the business is performing, I mean if you exclude the COVID piece, which was pretty significant for us and then just look at the business without the base business, without the impacted nutrition products, our growth rate was about 11%. And I think that reflects the strength of the portfolio, the investments that we've made and the execution. So in that guidance, that reiteration of $470 million, we've absorbed, as Bob said, more FX headwinds, absorbed some challenges in supply chain, absorbed portions of the nutrition recall. So I think it's the right EPS guide right now in terms of where we are after Q1. Great. And maybe as a follow-up, I think a lot of investors are focused on the go forward, realizing that January and February weren't the strongest months due to some of the elevated Omicron levels. So we heard Johnson & Johnson yesterday talk about reaching pre-COVID volume levels in April. It sounds like you exited and continue to see strong growth coming out of the quarter and into second quarter. I was hoping maybe you could give us a little more color on just the volume trends you're seeing, particularly in devices and diabetes, which was one that missed the street a little bit in the quarter? And how you're seeing the geographic spread and any differences there? Sure. I mean I think the storyline here was very similar, as I said in my comments. I mean it started off a little bit slower than we had anticipated in January, obviously, given Omicron and the surges there and the pressure that, that put on staff at hospitals. But definitely sequential improvement from a dollar perspective every month as we moved along the quarter, March was very strong. I've always talked about how we compare our businesses versus pre-pandemic levels to kind of avoid some of the comp issues that ultimately do exist. \\r\\nIf you look at our Q1 '22 growth rate versus 2019, we were up about 7.3%. So well ahead of where we were in 2019. And that was pretty broad-based. Geographically, the U.S. was up 6%, again versus 2019. And international was up over 8% versus 2019, too. So I think our device business has performed very well, and we've seen that improvement as we went through the quarter. The cardiovascular side has done very well as I've kind of given those numbers, and March was really strong, too. \\r\\nI think it's -- part of it is recovery, Robbie, that we're seeing. But also -- I would also put in those numbers, I made these comments about recently launched products that we started launching last year. It's always a challenge to launch these new technologies in that COVID environment, but it was the right decision to make, and we're seeing good momentum on whether it's Amulet, Navitor in Europe, CardioMEMS, the rollout of EnSite X that began in Q4 of last year, our TriClip product. So I think all of that, it's the combination, I would say, of both recovery as the COVID cases subside, but also the new product launches and the pipeline that we put, which is driving this performance where, I'd say, we're ahead of where we were in 2019, having good growth rate in our cardio portfolio. Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Robert, maybe back on the guidance question, right. The testing guidance was raised by $2 billion, right? That's perhaps $0.40 of upside and reiteration of the EPS, like what is offsetting the incremental tailwind from COVID rate? Like how much of this is FX, was this macro Russia versus the recall or inflationary pressures, I think, a little bit more granularity will be helpful. Sure. Well, I mean I think you hit on the key points there. I mean inflation -- additional inflation pressures is impacting some of that. We've got a couple of hundred million dollars that we've contemplated throughout the rest of the year in terms of friction on supply chain costs, input costs, freight and distribution. \\r\\nThe recall -- well, let me take a step back, the FX is probably about another about $0.05 of friction that we're having as we've seen the dollar strengthen and the rest of it is really coming from nutrition, but it's very difficult right now to be able to kind of pinpoint exactly. We've got a couple of different scenarios, as I said in the first question in terms of the restart and the curve. So we are seeing more COVID tests and more COVID sales. And that, like I said, is absorbing some of these challenges. And then one on Libre. Sequentially, your revenue has declined. And I guess my question is you've been adding, I think, a couple of hundred thousand new patients starts. Is that new patient starts changing at all? How should we think about the incremental reimbursement in Japan? And was the seasonality or what drove the sequential Libre revenue trends? Yes. I mean I think we see some of that from time to time here, especially as you go from Q4 to Q1, Vijay. We've seen that a couple of times. I'd say internationally, the biggest driver of that is actually FX that created that. We've seen good growth internationally from Libre getting close to 20% on a very large base. And in the U.S., you're going to see some timing patterns there in terms of wholesaler ordering. I like to look at scripts, both new-to-brand scripts and total Rx scripts here in the U.S. and the sequential Q1 to Q4, there's definitely growth there. \\r\\nSo I think we've done a really good job in the U.S. We've grown our business in this quarter by 50%. Users now well over 1 million users. We've made the investments in the U.S., whether it's Salesforce, DTC advertising. I think the team is beginning to hit its stride over there. They know that I'm not satisfied. We always want to see more and believe that we can do more. But I think the U.S. is starting to kind of really hit its stride with those investments as the sales force gets deployed and establishes the relationships with what is new physicians that are getting introduced to CGM. So I think that's worked out very well. \\r\\nIf I take a step back, though, and move away a little bit from the RXs and the sequential, I think one of the key things here to really take a look at is the evolution of the CGM market. And I'm starting to really see now what we had always envisioned this market to start to be, which is a market that is shifting from what traditionally was more of a type 1, more of a pumper -- insulin pump kind of connectivity play, which is an important segment, but really start to move and expand beyond that. And we're starting to see signs of that. And I think Libre is a big driver. The value proposition of Libre is a big driver, whether it's physicians and payers, quite frankly, starting to see the value of the sensing technology across a much broader set of patients. \\r\\nIf you look at a U.S. base of patients, and we get to see this because we get to see the Rx data in terms of what medications the patients are using. And over 40% of our user base, which is pretty large in the U.S., is already type 2 non-intensive. And that, as I said, is really kind of an opportunity to expand this market and become a really strong growth driver. The Japan reimbursement that you just referenced, again, this goes back to a comment I made about. We see this as a mass market opportunity. \\r\\nSo counter to maybe how we think about reimbursement in different segments of devices where you're thinking about price of reimbursement versus patient TAM, we're looking at patient TAM much more than we are on the pricing side. We've got great reimbursement in Japan, but to be able to have access to all insulin users in Japan with our product is a great opportunity for us. \\r\\nAnd then you're seeing the value proposition, again, really strong. There was a study that was published by U.K. NICE. And I think that, for me, is the ultimate validation of our strategy and the value proposition we offer where it was clearly shown to be extremely cost effective, whether you look at ICERs or Qualys in the U.K. by NICE and their view here of how this can benefit a lot of patients. \\r\\nSo that for me is the real exciting part of Libre is we're really starting to see that evolution from the CGM market to become much more than kind of a niche play and much more mass market play. And I think we're starting to see evidence of that, whether it's new studies or reimbursement access or even seeing physicians primary care docs start to really embrace the prescription of CGM for type 2s. So... Our next question comes from Josh Jennings from Cowen. Congratulations on a strong start to the year. Rob and Bob, I just wanted to start with just a question on gross margins. The 1Q performance was the highest since 20 -- quarters in 2019. Just wanted to better understand the sustainability of this profile? 59.1% despite all the challenges in place in 1Q, and then -- and should investors be thinking that return to 2019 gross margin levels in that 59% range plus is achievable in the out years? \\r\\nAnd follow-up is on MitraClip. I just wanted to hear -- and Amulet, what have you learned in the early days, the Amulet launched as the #2 player in the U.S. left atrial appendage closure market that you can apply to your defense strategy starting this year, maybe carrying into next year when you're defending your MitraClip turf as the #1 player, assuming the U.S. [ PASCAL ] launch occurs in 2023? Okay. Josh, I'll take the kind of the gross margin question. In the first quarter, our gross margin certainly benefited from the very high COVID testing sales. As I mentioned in my remarks, that actually, the fall-through on that was higher than we've seen in the past because of the production volumes that we had going through our plant, we're basically running full out on that. So our first quarter definitely benefited from that.\\r\\nAs we look at the rest of the year, obviously, we're going to have the impact of the nutrition recall and the inflation, the increased inflation that Robert mentioned. Obviously, inflation is not unique to us. As we said back in January, we incorporated a sizable amount in our guidance at that point in time. And what we've seen, and I think a lot of other companies have seen as kind of an increase in some of those headwinds. And so we've captured that in our guidance for the rest of the year. \\r\\nWhen I think out beyond this year and where gross margin goes, I mean, gross margin is something we focus on in the company constantly. We've got dedicated teams within each business that are focused on driving gross margin improvements. I mean, a lot's going to depend, I think, as we think out in the future, the evolution of inflation and supply chain dynamics and how those evolve over time, that will be a key component. And then obviously, as we grow the top line in our medical device business, that's accretive to the overall profile of the company. And so that's kind of where we see gross margin right now and potentially in the future. Yes. On your question on MitraClip and Amulet, so I'll talk a little bit about MitraClip. I'd say the progression of MitraClip in the quarter was very similar to my commentary on our cardiovascular procedure, right? So we obviously had high COVID case kind of impacted but started to really accelerate growth towards the end of February and into March. So as those cases came down, we saw the improving growth rate. \\r\\nBut I'll tell you, I mean, while the growth rate has been strong and it's been strong for a while, Josh, I don't think we've really been able to benefit yet from the FMR indication, which we got kind of right in the middle of COVID. And as part of that, and I talked a little bit about this, to be able to benefit from this pretty significant kind of market expansion opportunity that we had with incredible robust data from COAPT, you have to really start to work those patient referrals and the referral networks. And we began doing that when COVID took its first break, and then that got put on hold again when Delta and Omicron served. So I'm really looking forward and the team is kind of already putting in place that strategy, again, to reengage the patient referral network so that we can really take advantage of this indication, which is unique to us and will be unique to us for a while. \\r\\nRelating to competitive movements into the market, we just got to stay ahead. We've got to keep on investing in the product. So we've done that with MitraClip, staying ahead and iterating and improving on the performance of the product. We're investing in new trials. I talked about our investment that we're making in moderate risk surgery patients. That will be a great opportunity for us. \\r\\nAnd we have a great team, and we have great relationships and a strong mitral position. So not discounting the fact that we'll have competition. We've had competition in Europe for a couple of years already. Germany is probably the second largest global market, and our position there remains at an 80% market share. So I acknowledge that we will have competition, but we do -- we have established this mitral leadership position, and we intend to defend it because of all the investments that we've made to create this market. So that's what I would talk about MitraClip. I still think the best is still to come because I don't think we've been able to tap into the opportunity of the FMR indication. \\r\\nRegarding Amulet, listen, I think the team has done a really good job, again, reiterating the same kind of comments, a little bit challenged in the beginning of the quarter. And that was predominantly driven by the fact that we wanted to start the initial cases with every case being proctored. So difficult to move proctors throughout the U.S. and travel international, et cetera. \\r\\nSo that slowed us down a little bit in the beginning of the year. But I'll tell you, the team has done -- we spent a lot of time and attention and focus with them in February and March. And the team has definitely had a really strong exit to Q1, caught up in terms of all the contract closes that we had established as part of our plan in Q1. \\r\\nSo I think the commercial execution is doing really well, and that's supported really by the performance of the product. And once physicians have had an opportunity to get a couple of these implants done, it's a little bit of a different technique, but they feel comfortable with it and then they get the benefits of what the data shows is superior closure. And that's really because of our unique dual ceiling mechanism. \\r\\nSo there was some data that came out -- late-breaking data that came out of the AACC, which talked about the importance of leaks and leaks matter, whether they're big leaks or whether they're small leaks, they do matter. And even the small leaks were associated with an increase in thromboembolic events. So I think we're in a good position now with Amulet. I'm pleased with the commercial team and what they're doing in the clinical team, and we've got opportunities here to grow. I think momentum is building with Amulet. Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. So Robert, 2 high-level questions for me. One, I'll push my luck a little bit and see if we can get any preliminary thoughts on 2023. You're getting a meaningful testing benefit this year, which may not materialize next year. So how do you feel about your ability to grow margins and earnings next year as testing demand drops? And I have one follow-up. Sure. Well, we had a really strong quarter regarding testing, Larry. And I think to answer your question, I think you have to kind of look at what's going on a little bit right now in the U.S. and internationally. In the U.S., we saw cases decline pretty significantly in February. But I think we all agree that some of those cases that are being reported aren't covering all cases because of the use of the at-home testing systems, right, that are currently available. So I think that's part of the process that we're seeing as testing -- as we're moving more into this kind of endemic state. \\r\\nAnd as we move to this endemic state, listen, vaccines have been incredibly powerful to be able to prevent serious illness to be able to protect the hospitals and the hospital system, but it's really testing that really allows us to kind of move to this endemic state and kind of live our day-to-day and it's more about surveillance and screening and checking. So -- and I think our product has done really well here. It's maintained a kind of preferred status here in the U.S., even with a pretty significant increase in product coming into the country, whether it's ease of use, its shelf life, the reliability it has, its studies, et cetera. \\r\\nSo I think that, that's an important aspect as we go into 2023 is do we have confidence that even in an endemic state does testing continue? And I would say, yes, it does continue. One portion that doesn't get a lot of attention is our international testing business. 50% of our sales in March of COVID tests came from the international markets. And I'd say, similar sense there of governments investing in testing and coming to Abbott as one of the preferred suppliers. \\r\\nSo I think that to answer your question, obviously, there's a certain amount that you can't overcome, right? But I do think that as we go into next year, we'll have a portion of our testing business that will look more like a flu kind of respiratory kind of endemic state. And I think that's going to be important as we continue to grow earnings. \\r\\nAnd then on top of that, like I said, the focus of our medical device business, the investments we've made in our diagnostic systems and increasing the test menus over there. So I expect our base business to continue to grow very strongly. Yes, it's a little bit early regarding 2023, but we are planning. We are looking. We are looking at where we're going to be able to kind of grow and I'd say there will be some COVID business next year. I think we're in probably the strongest position to be able to kind of capitalize and lead in that market. And then our base business is going to do very strongly next year with all the investments we've made and new product pipeline that we've got. And Robert, you're in a unique position with your strong balance sheet. I saw you mentioned on the call, you bought back, I think, $2.5 billion in stock this quarter. What are your updated thoughts on M&A? And if you can't find attractive assets, are you going to continue to return cash to shareholders like we saw this past quarter? Sure. On the M&A side, yes, I mean, I'll sound like a broken record here, Larry. I mean we're always looking. We're always studying. We're always looking at ways to be able to add to the company and add to our business, but it needs to be strategic. And from that perspective, I don't want to dilute our growth rate. I don't want to dilute our profiles. We need to make sure that we're looking at assets that will be additive to our growth into our profile. So at least the top line. So that's always there, and we're always looking. \\r\\nRegarding the approach, listen, it's always a balanced approach, Larry. We're generating strong cash flow. We got a lot of financial flexibility here. We'll return $3 billion when you -- in terms of dividend this year, Bob talked about what we've done regarding buybacks. And we're always going to look at this kind of balanced approach. \\r\\nWe've made investments in our organic opportunities for growth because I believe that those are great returns for our shareholders, whether it's Libre, MitraClip, expansion of our medical devices, diagnostics, those are all opportunities that deliver great returns for our shareholders, and we'll take that balanced approach. And if there is an opportunity for more, we'll do more. Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. I'd like to circle back a little bit to the nutritional business. A lot of the feedback that I get from investors is some level of concern regarding brand name, brand damage, if you will. And I'm curious your thoughts on what it would take to sort of revamp this business up? Sorry, you're referring to Nutrition business? Yes. Okay. Listen, we've got a very robust manufacturing network and a robust quality system. Obviously, there's a shortage of product in the market. I highlighted some of the things that we're doing to be able to kind of resupply the market. A key aspect of that is going to be the restart, and we're in that process. \\r\\nWe've got a strong brand with Similac. We've maintained a lot of contracts. We've been able to supply those contracts even with a little bit of this shortage. So I feel confident in our team's ability here to look at once we get restarted to be able to resupply the market and build back our share. We had just launched a new product last year -- end of last year with a blend of 5 HMOs and that's a significant advancement. And we were expecting that based on everything that we had studied and seen was going to be a big growth driver for us and kind of brand enhancers. So I think that's going to be important. \\r\\nAnd yes, we'll have to make some investments as we go back to the market. But I'd say historically, when some of these issues have happened in the past, whether it's Abbott or other manufacturers, share does recover. The question is just kind of the timing and the curve of that recovery, but share do come to recover and you can look at past situations with other competitors and even with us. And as a follow-up, forgive me for asking it this way. What's next? I mean, I don't think we're going to be talking about COVID testing in a year. I hope we're not going to be talking about it. But how do you see the sort of forward momentum of the company? Big picture? Yes. Well, yes, I don't think we're going to be talking about COVID testing the way we're talking about it today or how we talked about it in the past year. But like I told Larry, I mean, I do think that there's going to be an opportunity for COVID testing to play a role in this kind of endemic state. \\r\\nAnd as I've said in the past also, what COVID has allowed us to do is to further accelerate what we believe was a key trend in diagnostics and point-of-care diagnostics, which is the expansion and the decentralization of that testing outside of the lab into pharmacies, into people's homes and it being connected. \\r\\nSo I think that -- COVID has accelerated that, I guess, I would say. And we're obviously building menus where we'll be able to add to the ID NOW instrument, more panels, more different tests. Remember, when we started the pandemic, we had about 20,000 kind of instruments that's now fivefold in terms of the opportunity that we have to be able to expand menu into basically an asset that's been capitalized and deployed into the market. So that's what we've been working on from that perspective on the, I guess, I would say, on the rapid testing side on the decentralized testing side. \\r\\nI'd say going back to the device portfolio, I mean there's still a lot of what next in our pipeline of products that we've just launched that are still in the early innings here. One of them that we got approved this quarter, which I'm really excited about, is Aveir and our leadless pacemaker. I think this is going to be a great opportunity to kind of reignite growth back in our CRM business. I mean we've seen an improvement already with the existing portfolio and had a 4% growth this quarter. \\r\\nBut I think Aveir is a real kind of game changer for our CRM portfolio. Obviously, the single chamber is a smaller part of the market. We know that it's about 15%. But I think when you're coming second to the market, you get to observe what needs to -- what could be addressed that maybe the first generation didn't do. And I think that our product whether it's retrievability, its ability to be retrieved, it's longer-lasting battery. \\r\\nRight now, it's about 2x product that's on the market. But I think what's really exciting about this is its ability to upgrade to a dual chamber device. So it's upgradability is what we're hearing extremely big interest from the physician community. So I think that's a great opportunity for us that I think is really going to start to show as we evolve our trial for dual chamber and begin to collect data there. I think that's going to be a great opportunity for our CRM portfolio. \\r\\nI look at CardioMEMS as another great opportunity that we have just really just started. The expanded indication is going to really open up the market. I've seen some of the implant trends that we've seen post-expansion indication, and that gives me a lot of excitement about what this product can be. We talked about Amulet. I think that the TAVR piece is one that, as I've said in the past, we're investing. I think Navitor is an extremely competitive product, and we're seeing that in Europe as we've launched it and been 6 months in the market now. \\r\\nSo there's great opportunities over there. Libre 3 is an opportunity for us, not only in the U.S., but in Europe to continue to expand the market. I think Lingo, as I said in the last call, is another great opportunity that is really in the early stages. But look at using our biowearable sensors outside of diabetes and looking at opportunities there. \\r\\nSo I think we have a lot of what next that are truly early in their early stages. And then on top of all the products that we've been talking about right now also. So I'm excited about the what next. Our next question comes from Travis Steed from Bank of America. Curious on the inflation supply chain, sounds like it's gotten about $200 million worse than the $500 million you had built into the P&L, just to confirm that. I'm curious what you're seeing the biggest pain points? Is it wages, raw materials, shipping costs and expectations on when that could start to ease to some degree? Or how you're thinking for a potential offset with price? Yes. Travis, I'll take the question. This is Bob. So as we said back in January, we did incorporate a sizable impact into our 2022 guidance, which was about $500 million on the gross margin line. And as Robert mentioned, we've now incorporated an additional $200 million in gross margin impact in our current guidance. The biggest impact we're seeing is really on logistics and commodities and some other manufacturing inputs. It's not so much on the labor front. Labor is a smaller portion of our total product cost. So it's really on the commodities. \\r\\nIn terms of when this will ease and change, I mean, that's a very -- I think there's a lot of things that affect that and where the -- where inflation may go. We do know that historically, on commodities, we do see cycles. We do see commodity costs go up, but they also come down. And we would expect at some point, and it's very difficult to kind of call exactly when that will be, we will see some of the inflationary pressures subside. And then given your presence in China, I would just kind of love to hear your thoughts on both China from a procedure standpoint and also a supply chain standpoint, just given how much of the business you have there? And any thoughts on the progress you're making with Libre 3 and the FDA would be great, too. Sure. I think regarding China, I saw a little bit of an inverse in terms of what we saw in all the other geographies where started off pretty well in the quarter. And then as the lockdown started to occur, specifically in Shanghai towards the end of February and into March, started to kind of see the impact of that in our procedures. \\r\\nWe look at our testing platforms as kind of an early indicator and a proxy. So we saw those go down also during the month of April -- during the month of March. And I'd say, over the last 2 weeks in April, started to see a recovery of those diagnostic testing. So I think what we saw was a lot of the testing that was being done in the major kind of cities was shifted over to kind of PCR testing, together with rapid testing and that obviously impacted some of the routine hospital testing. \\r\\nBut we're starting to see that now probably 2 solid weeks of kind of positive trend back in the right direction. Still not at the level we were before the lockdowns, but definitely starting to move in the right direction there. \\r\\nSo I would expect just based on patterns that we've seen in the past that we're starting to kind of move to sequential week-over-week improvements in the procedures. And not all procedures are the same. Some of them return faster. Some of them have a different kind of recovery curve. But I do expect kind of the impact that we saw in March and a little bit in the beginning of April and devices start to kind of improve. Sorry, you had a question on Libre 3? Yes, Libre 3. Any update on how the progress is working with the FDA or what the label might look like? Just any additional color would be great. Sure. Like I mentioned in the call, we filed as an ICGM. I don't have much to kind of update you there regarding that. I will say that we have moved Libre 3 in Europe into -- from kind of more of a limited rollout in Germany a while back to kind of more of an accelerated conversion from Libre 2 to Libre 3. \\r\\nAnd I think the process started really well in Germany. We got initial feedback from physicians, very positive feedback from the reimbursement system also. And that gave us the confidence here to kind of really begin to accelerate this market transition in Libre 3. We did that in Libre 2 also when we moved from Libre 1 to Libre 2 in Germany. That took us about a year. I think it's going to be faster than that with Libre 3. And we've got over 90% reimbursement coverage for Libre 3 in Germany. \\r\\nSo that's now moved into high gear, not only in Germany, but for the rest of the year. So I'm focused a lot on what we can do with Libre in the countries that we do have it approved. And right now, everything that we're seeing is that it is a very, very compelling product. Okay. Operator, we'll take one more question. Our last question will come from Matt Miksic from Credit Suisse. Just in the context of some of these new products, I did want to maybe follow up with just a level set expectations, for example, the Avidity rollout and menu expansion, very strong growth in the quarter. Robert, if you could maybe talk about what's the duration of this rollout? I know it started into the pandemic. And what does that look like through this year and potentially through next year? \\r\\nAnd then I know you touched this a few times here about Amulet. Just love to get your updated thoughts on where you think share could go in the next year, 18 months? You've made some comments in Q4. I know the pace is picking up here in the U.S.? Any numbers you could put around your thoughts there would be super helpful. Sure. I mean Alinity is a multiyear strategy and rollout here, Matt. We're doing it not only with immunoassay, we're doing with clinical chemistry, we're doing with hematology. We're doing it with transfusion. This has never been done at this kind of scale to be able to really recycle all of our systems. So I think that if you look at the way the market is set up, the contracts are lasting between 7 to 10 years. So on any given year, you've got 15% of the market that's coming up for an RFP. \\r\\nSo regarding its legs like you're asking, I mean, I still think that we've got multiple, multiple years here. The COVID pandemic definitely slowed that down in terms of the renewal cycles, a lot of hospitals focusing on just dealing with the COVID. But I guess what I would say is there's plenty more to come. The key here is the balance between -- in that 15% that comes up for RFP, what's renewable to an existing customer and what's kind of share gain. And I think the team has done a really good job at being able to look at having a real strong balance about not just defending the base, and we've done that pretty well. So I'd say, 9 out of 10 accounts, we've been able to maintain. \\r\\nAnd then if you look at the business that's coming up for grabs, I'd say our win rate here is over 50%. So when you think about that math, retaining 90% and winning 50% of the new businesses, that's what ultimately drives our top line growth. And then once you put those instruments in, then the key aspect here is to be able to expand the menu use of those instruments while they're in an account, right? \\r\\nYou've got the capital deployed, you've got the service cost that's kind of been deployed there. So everything we can do to be able to add new menus, new tests, et cetera, is accretive from both the top and the bottom line. So that's a big focus of the team on the R&D side is to be able to expand the menus concurrent to what I would say is kind of placement strategy that we have with the new systems. \\r\\nSo Amulet -- on your question on Amulet, listen, I think we continue to capture share. We estimate that we're in double-digit share position here in the U.S. Longer term, I would say, our aspiration is to build a significant share position. The European market is much smaller than the U.S. market. In that market, we have a 50 share. So I think the key thing here is for us is to -- every time you're a new player coming into the market, you have different technology. We believe ours is superior, but it's different in terms of how it gets used, how it gets implanted. So you need to make sure that the physicians as you roll it out learn how to use our product, our implant, our system. \\r\\nAnd from there, you build off there. So I think we'll be looking at not only expansion into new accounts, but also utilization in existing accounts. And that's the piece that I'm actually getting very excited about it. As we've looked at the accounts that we started back in September and October, we're starting to see nice share movement over there. So that's very exciting for us. \\r\\nSo let me just close here. I think we've had a very strong start to the year, like I said in my prepared comments. We've reaffirmed our guidance that we set back in January, absorbing, I would say, impact of the nutrition recall, which we're working hard on to restart. Other parts and attrition are doing very well, and I expect them to continue to do very well. We're absorbing, as Bob said, challenges with inflation in the supply chain that many companies I know are facing, and we're absorbing some headwinds on FX side. \\r\\nThat being said, there's a lot of great things that are going on at Abbott in the company, a lot of positives. I talked about them in the beginning of the call. And I expect all of that positive to continue and to that momentum to continue to build on that business. Like I said, excluding COVID, excluding some of the recall products, our base business grew 11% in the quarter and the team is focused on building off that and building off that momentum. So thanks. Very good. Thank you, operator, and thank you for all of your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11:00 a.m. Central Time today on Abbott's Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank you for joining us today. Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.
